Green turtles breeding at Ascension Island perform long oceanic migrations (\textbackslash textgreater2200 km) between foraging areas along the Brazilian coast and the isolated island.

We propose that only traits showing a clear domesticated\textendash wild dimorphism represent the pristine domestication episode, whereas traits showing a phenotypic continuum between wild and domesticated gene pools mostly reflect post-domestication diversification. We propose that our approach may apply to other crop types and examine its implications for discussing the timeframe of plant domestication and for modern plant science and breeding.},

  abstract = {Distribution, abundance, diet, and beak morphology of the six Geospiza finch species were studied at eight sites on seven Galapagos islands. The resulting information was used to test the theories of Lack and Bowman that interspecific competition (Lack) and floristic and food differences among islands (Bowman) determine the ecological and morphological characteristics of the finches. Both factors were found to be important in different aspects of finch ecology. Most of the 21 populations studied spent more time foraging for seeds and fruits than for insects. Most populations had generalized diets and nine out of 18 pairs of sympatric populations had diets overlapping by 50\% or more. Diet breadth was positively correlated with variety of available foods (classified by an index comprising measures of size and hardness), but was not correlated with abundance or biomass of sympatric populations of finches (potential competitors). Competitive release, in the form of large population biomass on islands with few congeners, was not found. Nor was population biomass related to variety of available food. Overlap in diet between two species was greatest when the species were most similar in abundance and body size. Interspecific competition is indicated by the distribution and morphology of the finches. The absence of four combinations of species cannot be attributed to change: (1) G. conirostris and G. fortis, (2) G. conirostris and G. scandens, (3) G. difficilis and G. fuliginosa, and (4) G. scandens and G. difficilis. These absences cannot be attributed to the absence of suitable foods. and sites with similar floras and suites of food types do not necessarily have similar ground finch faunas. The ecological and morphological similarity of members of each of the four pairs suggests an inability to coexist for competitive reasons. In contrast, where only two species occur together on an island they tend to differ markedly in size (beak and body) and diet. Species with large beaks can eat larger and harder seeds and fruits than species with small beaks, and as a consequence they tend to have more diverse diets. Species with large beaks also eat medium-sized seeds and fruits quicker than species with small beaks. Species with small beaks may be able to deal with small soft seeds more efficiently than species with large beaks, but the data are not clear on this point. In addition, small species with small beaks have a metabolic advantage over large species with large beaks. Variety of available foods influences the large species more than the small species: the two largest species, G. magnirostris and G. conirostris, occur only on sites where plants producing large and hard seeds and fruits are plentiful. Food variety apparently does not influence the degree of diet overlap. The number of plant species on an island statistically determines the number of land-bird species in general, and Geospiza species in particular, which occur on that island. The influence is probably mediated through food supply, since 53\% of the variation in Geospiza species diversity among the eight sites was accounted for in a multiple linear regression analysis by diversity of available seeds and fruits. We conclude that food supply and interspecific competition have jointly determined the ecological course of the radiation of Darwin's finches and the resulting pattern of species diversity. Interisland variation in vegetation favored the initial steps of differentiation. Competitive interactions among species influenced later stages by determining which ecological types could coexist on an island with a given array of foods.

  abstract = {Background The quality of wheat grain depends on several characteristics, among which the composition of high molecular weight glutenin subunits, encoded by Glu-1 loci, are the most important. Application of biotechnological tools to accelerate the attainment of homozygous lines may influence the proportion of segregated genotypes. The objective was to determine, whether the selection pressure generated by the methods based on in vitro cultures, may cause a loss of genotypes with desirable Glu-1 alleles. Results Homozygous lines were derived from six winter wheat crosses by pollination with maize (DH-MP), anther culture (DH-AC) and single seed descent (SSD) technique. Androgenetically-derived plants that originated from the same callus were examined before chromosome doubling using allele-specific and microsatellite markers. It was found that segregation distortion in SSD and DH-MP populations occurred only in one case, whereas in anther-derived lines they were observed in five out of six analyzed combinations. Conclusions Segregation distortion in DH-AC populations was caused by the development of more than one plant of the same genotype from one callus. This distortion was minimized if only one plant per callus was included in the population. Selection of haploid wheat plants before chromosome doubling based on allele-specific markers allows us to choose genotypes that possess desirable Glu-1 alleles and to reduce the number of plants in the next steps of DH production. The SSD technique appeared to be the most advantageous in terms of Mendelian segregation, thus the occurrence of residual heterozygosity can be minimized by continuous selfing beyond the F6 generation.},

  abstract = {Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most prevalent type of variation in genomes that are increasingly being used as molecular markers in diversity analyses, mapping and cloning of genes, and germplasm characterization. However, only a few studies reported large-scale SNP discovery in Aegilops tauschii, restricting their potential use as markers for the low-polymorphic D genome. Here, we report 68,592 SNPs found on the gene-related sequences of the 5D chromosome of Ae. tauschii genotype MvGB589 using genomic and transcriptomic sequences from seven Ae. tauschii accessions, including AL8/78, the only genotype for which a draft genome sequence is available at present. We also suggest a workflow to compare SNP positions in homologous regions on the 5D chromosome of Triticum aestivum, bread wheat, to mark single nucleotide variations between these closely related species. Overall, the identified SNPs define a density of 4.49 SNPs per kilobyte, among the highest reported for the genic regions of Ae. tauschii so far. To our knowledge, this study also presents the first chromosome-specific SNP catalog in Ae. tauschii that should facilitate the association of these SNPs with morphological traits on chromosome 5D to be ultimately targeted for wheat improvement.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Polyploidization has played an important role in plant evolution. However, upon polyploidization the process of meiosis must adapt to ensure the proper segregation of increased numbers of chromosomes to produce balanced gametes. It has been suggested that meiotic gene (MG) duplicates return to a single copy following whole genome duplication to stabilise the polyploid genome. Therefore, upon the polyploidization of wheat, a hexaploid species with three related (homeologous) genomes, the stabilization process may have involved rapid changes in content and expression of MGs on homeologous chromosomes (homeologs). To examine this hypothesis, sets of candidate MGs were identified in wheat using co-expression network analysis and orthology informed approaches. In total, 130 RNA-Seq samples from a range of tissues including wheat meiotic anthers were used to define co-expressed modules of genes. Three modules were significantly correlated with meiotic tissue samples but not with other tissue types. These modules were enriched for GO terms related to cell cycle, DNA replication and chromatin modification, and contained orthologs of known MGs. Overall 74.4 \% of genes within these meiosis-related modules had three homeologous copies which was similar to other tissue-related modules. Amongst wheat MGs identified by orthology, rather than co-expression, the majority (93.7 \%) were either retained in hexaploid wheat at the same number of copies (78.4 \%) or increased in copy number (15.3\%) compared to ancestral wheat species. Furthermore, genes within meiosis-related modules showed more balanced expression levels between homeologs than genes in non-meiosis-related modules. Taken together our results do not support extensive gene loss nor changes in homeolog expression of MGs upon wheat polyploidization. The construction of the MG co-expression network allowed identification of hub genes and provided key targets for future studies.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Author summary{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}All flowering plants have undergone a polyploidization event(s) during their evolutionary history. One of the biggest challenges faced by a newly-formed polyploid is meiosis, an essential event for sexual reproduction and fertility. This process must adapt to discriminate between multiple related chromosomes and to ensure their proper segregation to produce fertile gametes. The meiotic mechanisms responsible for the stabilisation of the extant polyploids remain poorly understood except in wheat, where there is now a better understanding of these processes. It has been proposed that meiotic adaptation in established polyploids could involve meiotic gene loss following the event of polyploidization. To test this hypothesis in hexaploid wheat, we have computationally predicted sets of hexaploid wheat meiotic genes based on expression data from different tissue types, including meiotic anther tissue, and orthology informed approaches. We have calculated homeolog expression patterns and number of gene copies for the predicted meiotic genes and compared them with proper control gene sets. Our findings did not support any significant meiotic gene loss upon wheat polyploidization. Furthermore, wheat meiotic genes showed more balanced expression levels between homeologs than non-meiotic genes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Furthermore, these results demonstrate that flypaper traps share close common ancestry with all other trap forms.

Many studies have utilized these large data sets to make inferences about the demographic history of human populations using measures of genetic differentiation such as FST or principal component analyses. However, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip data suffer from ascertainment biases caused by the SNP discovery process in which a small number of individuals from selected populations are used as discovery panels. In this study, we investigate the effect of the ascertainment bias on inferences regarding genetic differentiation among populations in one of the common genome-wide genotyping platforms. We generate SNP genotyping data for individuals that previously have been subject to partial genome-wide Sanger sequencing and compare inferences based on genotyping data to inferences based on direct sequencing. In addition, we also analyze publicly available genome-wide data. We demonstrate that the ascertainment biases will distort measures of human diversity and possibly change conclusions drawn from these measures in some times unexpected ways. We also show that details of the genotyping calling algorithms can have a surprisingly large effect on population genetic inferences. We not only present a correction of the spectrum for the widely used Affymetrix SNP chips but also show that such corrections are difficult to generalize among studies.},

  abstract = {Background Polyploidy or whole-genome duplication is now recognized as being present in almost all lineages of higher plants, with multiple rounds of polyploidy occurring in most extant species. The ancient evolutionary events have been identified through genome sequence analysis, while recent hybridization events are found in about half of the world's crops and wild species. Building from this new paradigm for understanding plant evolution, the papers in this Special Issue address questions about polyploidy in ecology, adaptation, reproduction and speciation of wild and cultivated plants from diverse ecosystems. Other papers, including this review, consider genomic aspects of polyploidy.Approaches Discovery of the evolutionary consequences of new, evolutionarily recent and ancient polyploidy requires a range of approaches. Large-scale studies of both single species and whole ecosystems, with hundreds to tens of thousands of individuals, sometimes involving `garden' or transplant experiments, are important for studying adaptation. Molecular studies of genomes are needed to measure diversity in genotypes, showing ancestors, the nature and number of polyploidy and backcross events that have occurred, and allowing analysis of gene expression and transposable element activation. Speciation events and the impact of reticulate evolution require comprehensive phylogenetic analyses and can be assisted by resynthesis of hybrids. In this Special Issue, we include studies ranging in scope from experimental and genomic, through ecological to more theoretical.Conclusions The success of polyploidy, displacing the diploid ancestors of almost all plants, is well illustrated by the huge angiosperm diversity that is assumed to originate from recurrent polyploidization events. Strikingly, polyploidization often occurred prior to or simultaneously with major evolutionary transitions and adaptive radiation of species, supporting the concept that polyploidy plays a predominant role in bursts of adaptive speciation. Polyploidy results in immediate genetic redundancy and represents, with the emergence of new gene functions, an important source of novelty. Along with recombination, gene mutation, transposon activity and chromosomal rearrangement, polyploidy and whole-genome duplication act as drivers of evolution and divergence in plant behaviour and gene function, enabling diversification, speciation and hence plant evolution.},

We report the genotyping results of these markers on 23 wheat varieties, selected to represent a broad cross-section of wheat germplasm including a number of elite UK varieties. Finally, we show that, using relatively simple technology, it is possible to rapidly generate a linkage map containing several hundred single-nucleotide polymorphism markers in the doubled haploid mapping population of Avalon~\texttimes ~Cadenza.},

  abstract = {Food security is a global concern and substantial yield increases in cereal crops are required to feed the growing world population. Wheat is one of the three most important crops for human and livestock feed. However, the complexity of the genome coupled with a decline in genetic diversity within modern elite cultivars has hindered the application of marker-assisted selection (MAS) in breeding programmes. A crucial step in the successful application of MAS in breeding programmes is the development of cheap and easy to use molecular markers, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms. To mine selected elite wheat germplasm for intervarietal single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we have used expressed sequence tags derived from public sequencing programmes and next-generation sequencing of normalized wheat complementary DNA libraries, in combination with a novel sequence alignment and assembly approach.

  abstract = {MicroRNAs are critical players of post-transcriptional gene regulation with profound effects on the fundamental processes of cellular life. Their identification and characterization, together with their targets, hold great significance in exploring and exploiting their roles on a functional context, providing valuable clues into the regulation of important biological processes, such as stress tolerance or environmental adaptation. Wheat is a hardy crop, extensively harvested in temperate regions, and is a major component of the human diet. With the advent of the next generation sequencing technologies considerably decreasing sequencing costs per base-pair, genomic, and transcriptomic data from several wheat species, including the progenitors and wild relatives have become available. In this study, we performed in silico identification and comparative analysis of microRNA repertoires of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and its diploid progenitors and relatives, Aegilops sharonensis, Aegilops speltoides, Aegilops tauschii, Triticum monococcum, and Triticum urartu through the utilization of publicly available transcriptomic data. Over 200 miRNA families were identified, majority of which have not previously been reported. Ancestral relationships expanded our understanding of wheat miRNA evolution, while T. monococcum miRNAs delivered important clues on the effects of domestication on miRNA expression. Comparative analyses on wild Ae. sharonensis accessions highlighted candidate miRNAs that can be linked to stress tolerance. The miRNA repertoires of bread wheat and its diploid progenitors and relatives provide important insight into the diversification and distribution of miRNA genes, which should contribute to the elucidation of miRNA evolution of Poaceae family. A thorough understanding of the convergent and divergent expression profiles of miRNAs in different genetic backgrounds can provide unique opportunities to modulation of gene regulation for better crop performance.},

The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straight-forward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

Age-related division of labor in honey bee colonies, a highly derived behavioral system, involves the performance of different feeding-related tasks by different groups of individuals. Older bees acquire the colony's food by foraging for nectar and pollen, and the younger "nurse" bees feed larvae processed foods. The transition from hive work to foraging has been shown to be socially regulated and associated both with decreases in abdominal lipid stores and with increases in brain expression of genes implicated in feeding behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we show that division of labor is influenced by a canonical regulator of food intake and energy balance in solitary species, the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway. Foragers had higher levels of IIS gene expression in the brain and abdomen than did nurses, despite their low lipid stores. These differences are likely nutritionally mediated because manipulations that induced low lipid stores in young bees also up-regulated these genes. Changes in IIS also causally influenced the timing of behavioral maturation: inhibition of the insulin-related target of rapamycin pathway delayed the onset of foraging in a seasonally dependent manner. In addition, pathway analyses of microarray data revealed that nurses and foragers differ in brain energy metabolism gene expression, but the differences are opposite predictions based on their insulin-signaling status. These results suggest that changes in the regulation of the IIS pathway are associated with social behavior.},

  abstract = {Recombination nodules (RNs) are closely correlated with crossing over, and, because they are observed by electron microscopy of synaptonemal complexes (SCs) in extended pachytene chromosomes, RNs provide the highest-resolution cytological marker currently available for defining the frequency and distribution of crossovers along the length of chromosomes. Using the maize inbred line KYS, we prepared an SC karyotype in which each SC was identified by relative length and arm ratio and related to the proper linkage group using inversion heterozygotes. We mapped 4267 RNs on 2080 identified SCs to produce high-resolution maps of RN frequency and distribution on each bivalent. RN frequencies are closely correlated with both chiasma frequencies and SC length. The total length of the RN recombination map is about twofold shorter than that of most maize linkage maps, but there is good correspondence between the relative lengths of the different maps when individual bivalents are considered. Each bivalent has a unique distribution of crossing over, but all bivalents share a high frequency of distal RNs and a severe reduction of RNs at and near kinetochores. The frequency of RNs at knobs is either similar to or higher than the average frequency of RNs along the SCs. These RN maps represent an independent measure of crossing over along maize bivalents.},

Here, we show that COP1 negatively regulates HY5, a bZIP protein and a positive regulator of photomorphogenic development. Both in vitro and in vivo assays indicate that COP1 interacts directly and specifically with HY5. The hyperphotomorphogenic phenotype caused by the over-expression of a mutant HY5, which lacks the COP1-interactive domain, supports the regulatory role of HY5-COP1 interaction. Further, HY5 is capable of directly interacting with the CHS1 minimal promoter and is essential for its light activation. We propose that the direct interaction with and regulation of transcription factors by COP1 may represent the molecular mechanism for its control of gene expression and photomorphogenic development.},

  abstract = {Segregation distortion (SD) is the deviation of genetic segregation ratios from their expected Mendelian fraction and is a common phenomenon found in most genetic mapping studies. In this study two segregating Lolium perenne populations were used to construct two genetic maps: an `F2 biomass' consisting of 360 genotypes and an `F1 late flowering' sibling based population consisting of 182 genotypes. Additionally two parental maps were generated for the `F1 late flowering' population. SD was detected and p-values for SD were calculated for each marker locus. The `F1 late flowering' map had only half of the extent of SD (32\%) compared to the map based on the `F2 biomass' population (63\%). Molecular marker data have been supplemented with genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) data to show non major non-recombined segments of Fescue chromosomes within the parental inbred ryegrass lines with a Festuca \texttimes{} Lolium pedigree. We conclude that SD in our study is more likely caused by genetic effects rather than by population structure and marker types. Two new L. perenne mapping populations including their genetic maps are introduced; one of them is the largest reported Lolium mapping population consisting of 360 individuals.},

Thus, allele-specific PCR with Taq polymerase offers the greatest template discrimination (40- to 100-fold) against mismatch to a primer's 3{${'}$}-terminal T, G, or C, but not A. Nucleotides at the penultimate position are responsible for roughly one-fifth as much mismatch discrimination (8- to 20-fold), and amplification efficiency is reduced when T and especially A occupy this primer position. We thus have defined conditions which allow robust discrimination for PCR-mediated analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and for reduction in complexity of anchor\textendash ligation PCR products.},

It has been hypothesized that helminths, like many free-living organisms, should optimize their development and reproduction in response to cues predicting future life expectancy. However, immune-dependent development by helminth parasites has so far eluded such evolutionary explanation. By manipulating various arms of the immune response of experimental hosts, we show that filarial nematodes, the parasites responsible for debilitating diseases in humans like river blindness and elephantiasis, accelerate their development in response to the IL-5 driven eosinophilia they encounter when infecting a host.

Eosinophilia is a primary host determinant of filarial life expectancy, operating both at larval and at late adult stages in anatomically and temporally separate locations, and is implicated in vaccine-mediated protection. Filarial nematodes are therefore able to adjust their reproductive schedules in response to an environmental predictor of their probability of survival, as proposed by evolutionary theory, thereby mitigating the effects of the immune attack to which helminths are most susceptible. Enhancing protective immunity against filarial nematodes, for example through vaccination, may be less effective at reducing transmission than would be expected and may, at worst, lead to increased transmission and, hence, pathology.},

  abstract = {Recent declines in costs accelerated sequencing of many species with large genomes, including hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Although the draft sequence of bread wheat is known, it is still one of the major challenges to developlocus specific primers suitable to be used in marker assisted selection procedures, due to the high homology of the three genomes. In this study we describe an efficient approach for the development of locus specific primers comprising four steps, i.e. (i) identification of genomic and coding sequences (CDS) of candidate genes, (ii) intron- and exon-structure reconstruction, (iii) identification of wheat A, B and D sub-genome sequences and primer development based on sequence differences between the three sub-genomes, and (iv); testing of primers for functionality, correct size and localisation. This approach was applied to single, low and high copy genes involved in frost tolerance in wheat. In summary for 27 of these genes for which sequences were derived from Triticum aestivum, Triticum monococcum and Hordeum vulgare, a set of 119 primer pairs was developed and after testing on Nulli-tetrasomic (NT) lines, a set of 65 primer pairs (54.6\%), corresponding to 19 candidate genes, turned out to be specific. Out of these a set of 35 fragments was selected for validation via Sanger's amplicon re-sequencing. All fragments, with the exception of one, could be assigned to the original reference sequence. The approach presented here showed a much higher specificity in primer development in comparison to techniques used so far in bread wheat and can be applied to other polyploid species with a known draft sequence.},

Behavioral imprinting of both male and female indigobirds on host song is thought to promote rapid speciation because it results in assortative mating between indigobirds associated with a particular host. We conducted a song playback experiment to test whether male indigobirds discriminate among potential competitors based on song. Of particular interest was the behavior of two sympatric host races of the Cameroon indigobird Vidua camerunensis that differ only in host song mimicry and other components of their vocal repertoires. Territorial males of the two V. camerunensis host races and Vidua raricola, a morphologically distinct indigobird species, were tested with playbacks of each other's songs. Males of all three groups responded most aggressively to songs of their own species and/or host race, as evidenced by strong and highly significant differences in a variety of response variables. This differential territorial defense suggests that an intruding male with different songs does not represent a competitive threat and is expected if females mate assortatively with respect to song. Thus, our results provide evidence of premating reproductive isolation among recently evolved indigobird species and host races.},

Although the genetic structure of landraces is collinear to ancient human migration roads, we observe a reshuffling through time, related to breeding programs, with the appearance of new alleles enriched with structural variations that may be the signature of introgressions from wild relatives after 1960.

  abstract = {The utility of the decimal growth stage (DGS) scoring system for cereals is reviewed. The DGS is the most widely used scale in academic and commercial applications because of its comprehensive coverage of cereal developmental stages, the ease of use and definition provided and adoption by official agencies. The DGS has demonstrable and established value in helping to optimise the timing of agronomic inputs, particularly with regard to plant growth regulators, herbicides, fungicides and soluble nitrogen fertilisers. In addition, the DGS is used to help parameterise crop models, and also in understanding the response and adaptation of crops to the environment. The value of the DGS for increasing precision relies on it indicating, to some degree, the various stages in the development of the stem apex and spike. Coincidence of specific growth stage scores with the transition of the apical meristem from a vegetative to a reproductive state, and also with the period of meiosis, is unreliable. Nonetheless, in pot experiments it is shown that the broad period of booting (DGS 41\textendash 49) appears adequate for covering the duration when the vulnerability of meiosis to drought and heat stress is exposed. Similarly, the duration of anthesis (61\textendash 69) is particularly susceptible to abiotic stresses: initially from a fertility perspective, but increasingly from a mean grain weight perspective as flowering progresses to DGS 69 and then milk development. These associations with DGS can have value at the crop level of organisation: for interpreting environmental effects, and in crop modelling. However, genetic, biochemical and physiological analysis to develop greater understanding of stress acclimation during the vegetative state, and tolerance at meiosis, does require more precision than DGS can provide. Similarly, individual floret analysis is needed to further understand the genetic basis of stress tolerance during anthesis.},

  abstract = {Background A high-throughput genotyping platform is needed to enable marker-assisted breeding in the allo-octoploid cultivated strawberry Fragaria\,\texttimes\,ananassa. Short-read sequences from one diploid and 19 octoploid accessions were aligned to the diploid Fragaria vesca `Hawaii 4' reference genome to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels for incorporation into a 90~K Affymetrix\textregistered{} Axiom\textregistered{} array. We report the development and preliminary evaluation of this array. Results About 36 million sequence variants were identified in a 19 member, octoploid germplasm panel. Strategies and filtering pipelines were developed to identify and incorporate markers of several types: di-allelic SNPs (66.6\%), multi-allelic SNPs (1.8\%), indels (10.1\%), and ploidy-reducing ``haploSNPs'' (11.7\%). The remaining SNPs included those discovered in the diploid progenitor F. iinumae (3.9\%), and speculative ``codon-based'' SNPs (5.9\%). In genotyping 306 octoploid accessions, SNPs were assigned to six classes with Affymetrix's ``SNPolisher'' R package. The highest quality classes, PolyHigh Resolution (PHR), No Minor Homozygote (NMH), and Off-Target Variant (OTV) comprised 25\%, 38\%, and 1\% of array markers, respectively. These markers were suitable for genetic studies as demonstrated in the full-sib family `Holiday'\,\texttimes\,`Korona' with the generation of a genetic linkage map consisting of 6,594 PHR SNPs evenly distributed across 28 chromosomes with an average density of approximately one marker per 0.5~cM, thus exceeding our goal of one marker per cM. Conclusions The Affymetrix IStraw90 Axiom array is the first high-throughput genotyping platform for cultivated strawberry and is commercially available to the worldwide scientific community. The array's high success rate is likely driven by the presence of naturally occurring variation in ploidy level within the nominally octoploid genome, and by effectiveness of the employed array design and ploidy-reducing strategies. This array enables genetic analyses including generation of high-density linkage maps, identification of quantitative trait loci for economically important traits, and genome-wide association studies, thus providing a basis for marker-assisted breeding in this high value crop.

With a comparative study of trap morphology, we show that Nepenthes pitcher plants have evolved specific adaptations for the use of either one of two distinct trapping mechanisms: slippery wax crystals on the inner pitcher wall and `insect aquaplaning' on the wet upper rim (peristome). Species without wax crystals had wider peristomes with a longer inward slope. Ancestral state reconstructions identified wax crystal layers and narrow, symmetrical peristomes as ancestral, indicating that wax crystals have been reduced or lost multiple times independently. Our results complement recent reports of nutrient source specializations in Nepenthes and suggest that these specializations may have driven speciation and rapid diversification in this genus.},

In many species, insects become trapped by 'aquaplaning' on the wet pitcher rim (peristome). Here we investigate the ecological implications of this capture mechanism in Nepenthes rafflesiana var. typica. We combine meteorological data and continuous field measurements of peristome wetness using electrical conductance with experimental assessments of the pitchers' capture efficiency. Our results demonstrate that pitchers can be highly effective traps with capture rates as high as 80\% but completely ineffective at other times. These dramatic changes are due to the wetting condition of the peristome. Variation of peristome wetness and capture efficiency was perfectly synchronous, and caused by rain, condensation and nectar secreted from peristome nectaries. The presence of nectar on the peristome increased surface wetness mainly indirectly by its hygroscopic properties. Experiments confirmed that pitchers with removed peristome nectaries remained generally drier and captured prey less efficiently than untreated controls. This role of nectar in prey capture represents a novel function of plant nectar. We propose that the intermittent and unpredictable activation of Nepenthes pitcher traps facilitates ant recruitment and constitutes a strategy to maximize prey capture.},

The upper pitcher rim (peristome) is fully wettable and causes insects to slip by aquaplaning on a thin water film. The high wettability of the peristome is probably achieved by a combination of hydrophilic surface chemistry, surface roughness and the presence of hygroscopic nectar. Insect foot attachment could be prevented by the delayed drainage of the thin water film between the adhesive pad and the surface. Drainage should be faster for insects with a hairy adhesive system; however, they slip equally on the wet peristome. Therefore the stability of the water film against dewetting appears to be the key factor for aquaplaning. New experimental techniques may help to clarify the detailed function of the pitcher plant peristome and to explore its potential for biomimetic applications.},

Rye is a diploid Triticeae species closely related to wheat and barley, and an important crop for food and feed in Central and Eastern Europe. Through whole-genome shotgun sequencing of the 7.9-Gbp genome of the winter rye inbred line Lo7 we obtained a de novo assembly represented by 1.29 million scaffolds covering a total length of 2.8 Gbp. Our reference sequence represents nearly the entire low-copy portion of the rye genome. This genome assembly was used to predict 27 784 rye gene models based on homology to sequenced grass genomes. Through resequencing of 10 rye inbred lines and one accession of the wild relative S. vavilovii, we discovered more than 90 million single nucleotide variants and short insertions/deletions in the rye genome. From these variants, we developed the high-density Rye600k genotyping array with 600 843 markers, which enabled anchoring the sequence contigs along a high-density genetic map and establishing a synteny-based virtual gene order.

The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

Following repeated exposures to synthetic bullfrog calls from a particular location, subjects responded significantly less aggressively to a familiar call, compared with an unfamiliar one, when both calls were broadcast from familiar and novel locations, indicating that bullfrogs could recognize a neighbour's calls independently of the contextual cues provided by the direction of the neighbour's territory. Subjects responded equally aggressively to unfamiliar calls broadcast from either a familiar or a novel location, which indicates that they could perceive unfamiliar calls as those of a stranger, regardless of where the stranger was encountered. Together, these two results provide evidence that a frog possesses a capacity for individual voice recognition.},

They are widely used in statistics and machine learning particularly to analyze biological networks. In this paper, we introduce the R package netgwas which is designed for accomplishing three important, and inter-related, goals in genetics: linkage map construction, reconstructing intra- and inter- chromosomal interactions and exploring high-dimensional genotype-phenotype (and genotypes-phenotypes-environments) network. The netgwas package has the capability of dealing with species of any ploidy level. The package implements the recent improvements in linkage map construction (Behrouzi and Wit, 2017a), and in inferring the conditional independence network for non-Gaussian, discrete, and mixed data (Behrouzi and Wit, 2017b), which routinely occurs in genetics and genomics such as genotype data, genotype-phenotype datasets, and genotype-phenotype including environmental variables. The package uses a parallelization strategy on multi-core processors to speed-up computations for large datasets. In addition, it contains several functions for simulation and visualization as well as three multivariate example datasets are taken from the literature and that are used to illustrate the package capabilities. The paper includes a brief overview of the statistical methods which have been implemented in the package. The main body of the paper explains how to use the package. Furthermore, we illustrate the package functionality with real examples.},

  abstract = {Linkage maps are important for fundamental and applied genetic research. New sequencing techniques have been created opportunities to increase substantially the density of genetic markers. With such revolutionary advances in technology come new challenges in methodologies and informatics. In this article, we introduce a novel linkage map algorithm to construct high-quality and high-density linkage maps for diploid and polyploid species. We propose to construct linkage maps using graphical models either via a sparse Gaussian copula or via a nonparanormal skeptic approach. Linkage groups (LGs), typically chromosomes, and the order of markers in each LG is determined by revealing the conditional independence relationships among a large number of markers in the genome. We illustrate the efficiency of the inference method on a broad range of synthetic data with varying rates of missingness and genotyping errors. We show that our method outperforms other available methods in terms of determining the correct number of linkage groups and ordering markers both when the data are clean and contain no missing observations and when data are noisy and incomplete. In addition, we implement the method on real genotype data of barley and potato from diploid and tetraploid populations, respectively. Given that most tetraploid potato linkage maps have been generated either from diploid populations (Felcher et al., 2012) or from a subset of marker types (e.g. both parents were heterozygous) (Grandke et al., 2017), developing a map construction method based on discrete graphical models opens the opportunities to construct high-quality linkage maps for any biparental diploid and polyploid species containing all different marker types. We have implemented the method in the R package netwgwas (Behrouzi and Wit, 2017b).},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses \textemdash{} the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {The success of high resolution genetic mapping of disease predisposition and quantitative trait loci in humans and experimental animals depends on the positions of key crossover events around the gene of interest. In mammals, the majority of recombination occurs at highly delimited 1\textendash 2 kb long sites known as recombination hotspots, whose locations and activities are distributed unevenly along the chromosomes and are tightly regulated in a sex specific manner. The factors determining the location of hotspots started to emerge with the finding of PRDM9 as a major hotspot regulator in mammals, however, additional factors modulating hotspot activity and sex specificity are yet to be defined. To address this limitation, we have collected and mapped the locations of 4829 crossover events occurring on mouse chromosome 11 in 5858 meioses of male and female reciprocal F1 hybrids of C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ mice. This chromosome was chosen for its medium size and high gene density and provided a comparison with our previous analysis of recombination on the longest mouse chromosome 1. Crossovers were mapped to an average resolution of 127 kb, and thirteen hotspots were mapped to {$<$}8 kb. Most crossovers occurred in a small number of the most active hotspots. Females had higher recombination rate than males as a consequence of differences in crossover interference and regional variation of sex specific rates along the chromosome. Comparison with chromosome 1 showed that recombination events tend to be positioned in similar fashion along the centromere-telomere axis but independently of the local gene density. It appears that mammalian recombination is regulated on at least three levels, chromosome-wide, regional, and at individual hotspots, and these regulation levels are influenced by sex and genetic background but not by gene content.},

A wide variety of approaches have been proposed to increase CO frequency, alter CO distribution and induce COs between non-homologous chromosomal regions. For most of these approaches, translational biology will be crucial for demonstrating how these strategies can be of practical use in plant breeding. In this review, we describe how tinkering with meiotic recombination could benefit plant breeding and give concrete examples of how these strategies could be implemented into breeding programs.},

However, care should be taken not to make hasty conclusions in light of the growing number of observations on the cultural abilities of different species, ranging from chimpanzees and orangutans to whales and dolphins. The present review concentrates on wild chimpanzees and shows that they all possess an extensive cultural repertoire. In the light of what we know from humans, I evaluate the importance of social learning leading to acquisition of cultural traits, as well as of collective meaning of communicative traits. Taking into account cross-cultural variations in humans, I argue that the cultural abilities we observe in wild chimpanzees present a broad level of similarity between the two species.},

  abstract = {Pitcher plants of the genus Nepenthes have highly specialized leaves adapted to attract, capture, retain, and digest arthropod prey. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the capture of insects, ranging from slippery epicuticular wax crystals to downward-pointing lunate cells and alkaloid secretions that anesthetize insects. Here we report that perhaps the most important capture mechanism has thus far remained overlooked. It is based on special surface properties of the pitcher rim (peristome) and insect "aquaplaning." The peristome is characterized by a regular microstructure with radial ridges of smooth overlapping epidermal cells, which form a series of steps toward the pitcher inside. This surface is completely wettable by nectar secreted at the inner margin of the peristome and by rain water, so that homogenous liquid films cover the surface under humid weather conditions. Only when wet, the peristome surface is slippery for insects, so that most ant visitors become trapped. By measuring friction forces of weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) on the peristome surface of Nepenthes bicalcarata, we demonstrate that the two factors preventing insect attachment to the peristome, i.e., water lubrication and anisotropic surface topography, are effective against different attachment structures of the insect tarsus. Peristome water films disrupt attachment only for the soft adhesive pads but not for the claws, whereas surface topography leads to anisotropic friction only for the claws but not for the adhesive pads. Experiments on Nepenthes alata show that the trapping mechanism of the peristome is also essential in Nepenthes species with waxy inner pitcher walls.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosoma mansoni and Plasmodium falciparum are common infections of school aged children in Kenya. They both cause enlargement of the spleen, but their relative contribution to the condition of splenomegaly remains unknown in areas where both infections are endemic. Here, we have investigated whether relatively high exposure to both infections has a clinically measurable effect on this condition. METHODS: 96 children aged 6-16 years living along a ten kilometre stretch and within 4 km south of a river that is a source of both S. mansoni and malaria infections were examined clinically for splenomegaly along the mid clavicular line (MCL) and mid axillary line (MAL). The survey was conducted outside the malaria transmission season. The consistency of the organ was recorded as soft, firm or hard. Mapping of the locations of houses and the course of the river was undertaken. Egg counts were mapped at the household level, as were IgG3 responses to Plasmodium falciparum schizont antigen (anti-Pfs IgG3), in order to identify areas with relatively high exposure to both infections, either infection or neither infection. ANOVA was used to test for differences in egg counts, IgG3 levels and the magnitude of spleen enlargement between these areas. RESULTS: 4 contiguous sectors were identified, one where anti-Pfs IgG3 responses and S. mansoni egg counts were both high, one where only anti-Pfs IgG3 responses were high, one where only egg counts were high, and one where both anti-Pfs IgG3 responses and egg counts were low. Spleen MAL and MCL values were significantly higher amongst children from the sector with highest IgG3 levels and highest egg counts but similar amongst children from elsewhere. Both egg counts and anti-Pfs IgG3 responses were significantly higher in children with MAL values \textbackslash textgreater or =4 cm. Hardening of spleens was associated with proximity of domicile to the river. CONCLUSIONS: Micro-geographical variation in exposure to S. mansoni and malaria infections can be exploited to investigate the chronic impact of these two infections. These results provide firm evidence that relatively high exposure to both infections exacerbates splenomegaly even outside the malaria transmission season. Major implications include assessing the burden of infection in school age-children.},

At 33\textdegree C, recombination-initiating double-strand breaks (DSBs) and noncrossover products (NCRs) form normally while formation of single-end invasion strand exchange intermediates (SEIs), double Holliday junctions, crossover products (CRs), and SC are coordinately defective. Thus, during wild-type meiosis, recombinational interactions are differentiated into CR and NCR types very early, prior to onset of stable strand exchange and independent of SC. By implication, crossover interference does not require SC formation. We suggest that SC formation may require interference. Subsequently, CR-designated DSBs undergo a tightly coupled, ZMM-promoted transition that yields SEI-containing recombination complexes embedded in patches of SC. zmm mutant phenotypes differ strikingly at 33\textdegree C and 23\textdegree C, implicating higher temperature as a positive effector of recombination and identifying a checkpoint that monitors local CR-specific events, not SC formation, at late leptotene.},

The basic principle of the mapping scheme is to develop, by recombinant DNA techniques, random single-copy DNA probes capable of detecting DNA sequence polymorphisms, when hybridized to restriction digests of an individual's DNA. Each of these probes will define a locus. Loci can be expanded or contracted to include more or less polymorphism by further application of recombinant DNA technology. Suitably polymorphic loci can be tested for linkage relationships in human pedigrees by established methods; and loci can be arranged into linkage groups to form a true genetic map of "DNA marker loci." Pedigrees in which inherited traits are known to be segregating can then be analyzed, making possible the mapping of the gene(s) responsible for the trait with respect to the DNA marker loci, without requiring direct access to a specified gene's DNA. For inherited diseases mapped in this way, linked DNA marker loci can be used predictively for genetic counseling.},

However, cumulative cultural evolution resulting in behaviours that no individual could invent on their own is limited to humans, song birds, and perhaps chimpanzees. Circumstantial evidence suggests that cumulative cultural evolution requires the capacity for observational learning. Here, we analyse two models of the evolution of psychological capacities that allow cumulative cultural evolution. Both models suggest that the conditions which allow the evolution of such capacities when rare are much more stringent than the conditions which allow the maintenance of the capacities when common. This result follows from the fact that the assumed benefit of the capacities, cumulatives cultural adaptation, cannot occur when the capacities are rare. These results suggest why such capacities may be rare in nature},

Eleven species of filamentous prokaryote, distinguished by shape and geometry, have been put forward as meeting the criteria required of authentic Archaean microfossils, and contrast with other microfossils dismissed as either unreliable or unreproducible. These structures are nearly a billion years older than putative cyanobacterial biomarkers, genomic arguments for cyanobacteria, an oxygenic atmosphere and any comparably diverse suite of microfossils. Here we report new research on the type and re-collected material, involving mapping, optical and electron microscopy, digital image analysis, micro-Raman spectroscopy and other geochemical techniques. We reinterpret the purported microfossil-like structure as secondary artefacts formed from amorphous graphite within multiple generations of metalliferous hydrothermal vein chert and volcanic glass. Although there is no support for primary biological morphology, a Fischer\textendash Tropsch-type synthesis of carbon compounds and carbon isotopic fractionation is inferred for one of the oldest known hydrothermal systems on Earth.},

Development of resistant varieties and identification of germplasm carrying new sources of resistance is necessary to preserve grain quality and yield. Resistance to FHB has been identified both within the gene pools of cultivated wheat and wild wheat relatives. In this study, a collection of the D genome species, Aegilops tauschii Coss. was evaluated for resistance to FHB. A total of 109 accessions of Ae. tauschii Coss. subsp. tauschii and Ae. tauschii Coss. subsp. strangulata (Eig) Tzvelev were infected with F. graminearum by single floret inoculation. Disease severity was rated as the percentage of infected spikelets at 21 days post-inoculation. A strong relationship was identified between geographical origin of Ae. tauschii accessions and FHB resistance. Generally, accessions from areas receiving high levels of annual rainfall were resistant whereas accessions from areas of low rainfall, more susceptible to FHB. High levels of FHB resistance were identified in accessions collected from regions bordering the Caspian Sea. The majority of accessions from arid regions were susceptible to FHB. The resistant germplasm identified in this study will support long-term FHB resistance breeding efforts.},

This is despite the potential public health importance of co-infection and synergistic opportunities for control. Methods: Statistical models are presented that predict the large-scale distribution of hookworm in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), based on the relationship between prevalence of infection among schoolchildren and remotely sensed environmental variables. Using a climate-based spatial model of the transmission potential for Plasmodium falciparum malaria, adjusted for urbanization, the spatial congruence of populations at coincident risk of infection is determined. Results: The model of hookworm indicates that the infection is widespread throughout Africa and that, of the 179.3 million school-aged children who live on the continent, 50.0 (95\% CI: 48.9\textendash 51.1) million (27.9\% of total population) are infected with hookworm and 45.1 (95\% CI: 43.9\textendash 46) million are estimated to be at risk of coincident infection. Conclusion: Malaria and hookworm infection are widespread throughout SSA and over a quarter of school-aged children in sub-Saharan Africa appear to be at risk of coincident infection and thus at enhanced risk of clinical disease. The results suggest that the control of parasitic helminths and of malaria in school children could be viewed as essential co-contributors to promoting the health of schoolchildren. Background},

  abstract = {Host plant resistance is an economical and environmentally sound method of control of leaf rust caused by the fungus Puccinia triticina, which is one of the most serious diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. Wild relatives of wheat, including the tetraploid T. timopheevii subsp. armeniacum, represent an important source of genes for resistance to leaf rust. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate the performance of leaf rust resistance genes previously transferred to wheat from three accessions of T. timopheevii subsp. armeniacum, (ii) determine inheritance and allelic relationship of the new leaf rust resistance genes, and (iii) determine the genetic map location of one of the T. timopheevii subsp. armeniacum-derived genes using microsatellite markers. The leaf rust resistance gene transferred to hexaploid wheat from accession TA 28 of T. timopheevii subsp. armeniacum exhibited slightly different infection types (ITs) to diverse races of leaf rust in inoculated tests of seedlings compared with the gene transferred from TA 870 and TA 874. High ITs were exhibited when seedlings of all the germ plasm lines were inoculated with P. triticina races MBRL and PNMQ. However, low ITs were observed on adult plants of all lines having the T. timopheevii subsp. armeniacum-derived genes for resistance in the field at locations in Kansas and Texas. Analysis of crosses between resistant germ plasm lines showed that accessions TA 870 and TA 874 donated the same gene for resistance to leaf rust and TA 28 donated an independent resistance gene. The gene donated to germ plasm line KS96WGRC36 from TA 870 of T. timopheevii subsp. armeniacum was linked to microsatellite markers Xgwm382 (6.7 cM) and Xgdm87 (9.4 cM) on wheat chromosome arm 2B long. This new leaf rust resistance gene is designated Lr50. It is the first named gene for leaf rust resistance transferred from wild timopheevi wheat and is the only Lr gene located on the long arm of wheat homoeologous group 2 chromosomes.},

  abstract = {Codifying Maize Modifications Maize, one of our most important crop species, has been the target of genetic investigation and experimentation for more than 100 years. Crossing two inbred lines tends to result in ``better'' offspring, in a process known as heterosis. Attempts to map the genetic loci that control traits important for farming have been made, but few have been successful (see the Perspective by Mackay). Buckler et al. (p. 714) and McMullen et al. (p. 737) produced a genomic map of maize that relates recombination to genome structure. Even tremendous adaptations in very diverse species were produced by numerous, small additive steps. Differences in flowering time in maize among inbred lines were not caused by a few genes with large effects, but by the cumulative effects of numerous quantitative trait loci\textemdash each of which has only a small impact on the trait. Flowering time is a complex trait that controls adaptation of plants to their local environment in the outcrossing species Zea mays (maize). We dissected variation for flowering time with a set of 5000 recombinant inbred lines (maize Nested Association Mapping population, NAM). Nearly a million plants were assayed in eight environments but showed no evidence for any single large-effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Instead, we identified evidence for numerous small-effect QTLs shared among families; however, allelic effects differ across founder lines. We identified no individual QTLs at which allelic effects are determined by geographic origin or large effects for epistasis or environmental interactions. Thus, a simple additive model accurately predicts flowering time for maize, in contrast to the genetic architecture observed in the selfing plant species rice and Arabidopsis. Assaying nearly one million plants reveals that maize flowering time is not controlled by a large effect at any single locus. Assaying nearly one million plants reveals that maize flowering time is not controlled by a large effect at any single locus.},

  abstract = {Meiotic drive is the subversion of meiosis so that particular genes are preferentially transmitted to the progeny. Meiotic drive generally causes the preferential segregation of small regions of the genome; however, in maize we propose that meiotic drive is responsible for the evolution of large repetitive DNA arrays on all chromosomes. A maize meiotic drive locus found on an uncommon form of chromosome 10 [abnormal 10 (Ab10)] may be largely responsible for the evolution of heterochromatic chromosomal knobs, which can confer meiotic drive potential to every maize chromosome. Simulations were used to illustrate the dynamics of this meiotic drive model and suggest knobs might be deleterious in the absence of Ab10. Chromosomal knob data from maize's wild relatives (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis and mexicana) and phylogenetic comparisons demonstrated that the evolution of knob size, frequency, and chromosomal position agreed with the meiotic drive hypothesis. Knob chromosomal position was incompatible with the hypothesis that knob repetitive DNA is neutral or slightly deleterious to the genome. We also show that environmental factors and transposition may play a role in the evolution of knobs. Because knobs occur at multiple locations on all maize chromosomes, the combined effects of meiotic drive and genetic linkage may have reshaped genetic diversity throughout the maize genome in response to the presence of Ab10. Meiotic drive may be a major force of genome evolution, allowing revolutionary changes in genome structure and diversity over short evolutionary periods.},

  abstract = {Over the last 10,000 years, crop domestication has been the single most important human cultural development. Grasses are prominent among these crops, and provide the vast majority of the world's food. Similar traits have been selected during the domestication and breeding of these critically important grasses, and since they share a similar complement of genes, the same set of genes may have been selected. Even though the process of domestication occurred over the same 5000 to 10,000 year period, the domesticated grasses have major differences in genome structure, diversity, and life history. Molecular investigations of grass domestication have succeeded in identifying progenitor species and are beginning to catalog genetic resources. Additionally, research is now elucidating some of the basic processes by which crops have evolved over the last few millennia. In this review, we discuss our present knowledge of molecular diversity among the grass crops and relate that diversity to the genes involved in domestication and to yield gains. Understanding the connection between diversity and genome structure will be critical to future crop breeding.},

Here we report the results of 12 years of hybridization and selection for the perfect wheat cultivar. `USU-Apogee' is a full-dwarf hard red spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar developed for high yields in controlled environments. USU-Apogee was developed by the Utah Agricultural Experiment Station in cooperation with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and released in April 1996. USU-Apogee is a shorter, higher yielding alternative to `Yecora Rojo' and `Veery-10', the short field genotypes previously selected for use in controlled environments. The yield advantage of USU-Apogee is 10 to 30\% over these other cultivars, depending on environmental conditions. USU-Apogee (45\textendash 50 cm tall, depending on temperature) is 10 to 15 cm shorter than Yecora Rojo and 1 to 4 cm shorter than Veery-10. USU-Apogee was also selected for resistance to the calcium-induced leaf tip chlorosis that occurs in controlled-environments. Breeder seed of USU-Apogee will be maintained by the Crop Physiology Laboratory and seed is available for testing on request.},

Chronic nutritional adversity during adulthood did not affect rover or sitter adult exploratory behavior; however, early nutritional adversity in the larval period increased sitter but not rover adult exploratory behavior. Increasing for gene expression in the mushroom bodies, an important center of integration in the fly brain, changed the amount of exploratory behavior exhibited by sitter adults when they did not experience early nutritional adversity but had no effect in sitters that experienced early nutritional adversity. Manipulation of the larval nutritional environment also affected adult reproductive output of sitters but not rovers, indicating GEIs on fitness itself.

  abstract = {Eyespot is an economically important stem base disease of wheat caused by the soilborne fungal pathogens Oculimacula yallundae and Oculimacula acuformis. The most effective method of controlling the disease is host resistance. However, there are only three genetically characterized resistances in wheat varieties and further sources of resistance are required. Previous studies have identified resistances in wild relatives, but use of these resistances has been limited by linkage drag with deleterious traits exacerbated by low rates of recombination. Therefore, the identification of novel resistances in hexaploid wheat germplasm is desirable. The Watkins collection currently consists of 1056 hexaploid wheat landraces that represent global wheat diversity at the time of its collection in the 1920s and 1930s. As such, it may contain beneficial agronomic traits such as eyespot resistance. The Watkins collection was screened for resistance to O. yallundae based on a glasshouse test of all 1056 accessions and a polytunnel test of 44 accessions selected from a previous field trial. Resistant lines identified in these tests were retested against both O. yallundae and O. acuformis. This identified 17 accessions with resistance to one or both of the pathogen species. From these, two accessions (1190094.1 and 1190736.3) provided a high level of resistance to both pathogen species. An F4 population derived from accession 1190736.3 indicated that the resistance to O. acuformis in this accession is conferred by a single gene and therefore would be suitable for introgression into elite wheat varieties to provide an alternative source of eyespot resistance.},

  abstract = {Repetitive DNA is widespread in eukaryotic genomes, in some cases making up more than 80\% of the total. SSRs are a type of repetitive DNA formed by short motifs repeated in tandem arrays. In some species, SSRs may be organized into long stretches, usually associated with the constitutive heterochromatin. Variation in repeats can alter the expression of genes, and changes in the number of repeats have been linked to certain human diseases. Unfortunately, the molecular characterization of these repeats has been hampered by technical limitations related to cloning and sequencing. Indeed, most sequenced genomes contain gaps owing to repetitive DNA-related assembly difficulties. This paper reports an alternative method for sequencing of long stretches of repetitive DNA based on the combined use of 1) a linear vector to stabilize the cloning process, and 2) the use of exonuclease III for obtaining progressive deletions of SSR-rich fragments. This strategy allowed the sequencing of a fragment containing a stretch of 6.2 kb of continuous SSRs. To demonstrate that this procedure can sequence other kinds of repetitive DNA, it was used to examine a 4.5 kb fragment containing a cluster of 15 repeats of the 5S rRNA gene of barley.},

  abstract = {The rapid appearance (over evolutionary time) of the cognitive skills and complex inventions of modern humans has been attributed to "cumulative cultural evolution" (CCE), the accumulation of knowledge and skills over generations. To date, researchers have only been able to speculate about the reasons for the apparent absence of this phenomenon in nonhumans, and it has not been possible to test hypotheses regarding the mechanisms underlying it. Here, we show that it is possible to demonstrate CCE under laboratory conditions by simulating generational succession through the repeated removal and replacement of human participants within experimental groups. We created "microsocieties" in which participants were instructed to complete simple tasks using everyday materials. In one of our procedures, participants were instructed to build a paper aeroplane which flew as far as possible, and in the other, they were instructed to construct a tower of spaghetti which was as tall as possible. We show that, in both cases, information accumulates within the groups such that later generations produce designs which are more successful than earlier ones. These methods offer researchers a window to understanding CCE, allowing for experimental manipulation and hypothesis testing. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Cumulative cultural evolution is the term given to a particular kind of social learning, which allows for the accumulation of modifications over time, involving a ratchet-like effect where successful modifications are maintained until they can be improved upon. There has been great interest in the topic of cumulative cultural evolution from researchers from a wide variety of disciplines, but until recently there were no experimental studies of this phenomenon. Here, we describe our motivations for developing experimental methods for studying cumulative cultural evolution and review the results we have obtained using these techniques. The results that we describe have provided insights into understanding the outcomes of cultural processes at the population level. Our experiments show that cumulative cultural evolution can result in adaptive complexity in behaviour and can also produce convergence in behaviour. These findings lend support to ideas that some behaviours commonly attributed to natural selection and innate tendencies could in fact be shaped by cultural processes.},

Here, we show that human participants' cumulative learning is not always reliant on sources of social information commonly assumed to be essential. Seven hundred participants were organized into 70 microsocieties and completed a task involving building a paper airplane. We manipulated the availability of opportunities for imitation (reproducing actions), emulation (reproducing end results), and teaching. Each condition was independently sufficient for participants to show cumulative learning. Because emulative learning can elicit cumulative culture on this task, we conclude that accounts of the unusual complexity of human culture in terms of species-unique learning mechanisms do not currently provide complete explanations and that other factors may be involved.},

Recently, this gene was found to be linked to a dwarfing gene through crossing Taigu with the short wheat T. aestivum `Ai-Bian~1' carrying the dwarfing gene Rht-D1c. The objective of this study was to develop molecular markers linked to the male sterility Ms2 gene in common wheat. One hundred and twenty-two near-isogenic lines were developed through backcrossing and sib intercrossing and used as the mapping population for the development of molecular markers. Bulked segregant analysis was used to screen 48 pairs of SSR primers, and a marker, MS2-WMC617, was identified closely linked to the male sterile Ms2 gene that mapped at the distal position of chromosome arm 4DS.

We tested the existence of male mate choice in the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor, by observing mating and courtship behaviour of males given simultaneous access to pairs of females differing in their reproductive status: (1) mature versus immature; (2) virgin versus previously mated; (3) familiar (mated with the experimental male) versus unfamiliar (mated with a different male). Males courted and mated preferentially with mature and virgin females. To determine whether chemical cues played a role in these discriminations, we exposed males to filter paper squares bearing chemical cues from different types of females: (1) virgin versus mated; (2) mature versus immature. Males were significantly more attracted to those squares bearing chemical cues from virgin and mature females, suggesting that males can assess female reproductive status on the basis of chemical cues alone. ?? 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

All the markers located on linkage group 4 exhibited strongly distorted segregation with respect to the expected Mendelian inheritance, towards the male parental line. This skewed segregation was also observed in a second F2 population of 50 plants derived from the same cross, confirming the presence of a region of distorted segregation on this linkage group and its heritability. The most skewed markers were SC-Y17 and TA72, which were tightly linked to each other, indicating that they may both be closely associated with the genetic factor responsible for segregation distortion in chickpea. To attempt to explain the non-Mendelian segregation, by identifying factors to which it could be attributed, three different chi-square tests were carried out to test different hypotheses using the data obtained from examining co-dominant markers associated with segregation distortion. According to our results, the distorted segregation could be caused by gametophytic factors that affect either male or female gametes. Pollen fertility and meiosis were also analysed to determine their relationship with segregation distortion; however, these not seem to be inducing factors in the non-Mendelian segregation reported in this study.},

Blocking one nostril causes moles to err in the direction of the open nostril with strongest effect within 4-5 cm of the stimulus. Nostril block does not severely disrupt more distant navigation towards odorants in a T-maze nor prevent animals from ultimately locating the odour source. Crossing inputs to the nostrils using plastic tubes causes a local repulsion from the stimulus, whereas uncrossed tubes do not disrupt localization. These findings show that mammals can make use of bilateral chemosensory cues combined with serial sampling to localize odorants and offer insights into the relative contribution of each strategy during different stages of natural search behaviours.},

This hypothesis was examined by giving zebra finch males, imprinted on either one or two species, preference tests in which zebra finch, Bengalese finch and hybrids of both species were used. For zebra finch males imprinted on both zebra finch and Bengalese finch, hybrids appeared to be more attractive stimulus birds than expected on the basis of the separate standard model. The results seem to fit better an alternative model, which assumes that zebra finch males combine the imprinted information of the two rearing species in one internal representation, consisting of elements of both species: the 'mixed standard model'.

To detect regions of the wheat genome subject to selection during improvement, we developed a high-throughput array to interrogate 9,000 gene-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in a worldwide sample of 2,994 accessions of hexaploid wheat including landraces and modern cultivars.

  abstract = {Background and Aims Despite the recent wealth of studies targeted at contact zones of cytotypes in various species, some aspects of polyploid evolution are still poorly understood. This is especially the case for the frequency and success rate of spontaneous neopolyploidization or the temporal dynamics of ploidy coexistence, requiring massive ploidy screening and repeated observations, respectively. To fill this gap, an extensive study of spatio-temporal patterns of ploidy coexistence was initiated in the widespread annual weed Tripleurospermum inodorum (Asteraceae).Methods DNA flow cytometry along with confirmatory chromosome counts was employed to assess ploidy levels of 11\,018 adult individuals and 1263 ex situ germinated seedlings from 1209 Central European populations. The ploidy screening was conducted across three spatial scales and supplemented with observations of temporal development of 37 mixed-ploidy populations.Key Results The contact zone between the diploid and tetraploid cytotypes has a diffuse, mosaic-like structure enabling common cytotype coexistence from the within-population to the landscape level. A marked difference in monoploid genome size between the two cytotypes enabled the easy distinction of neotetraploid mutants from long-established tetraploids. Neotetraploids were extremely rare (0{$\cdot$}03\,\%) and occurred solitarily. Altogether five ploidy levels (2x\textendash 6x) and several aneuploids were discovered; the diversity in nuclear DNA content was highest in early ontogenetic stages (seedlings) and among individuals from mixed-ploidy populations. In spite of profound temporal oscillations in cytotype frequencies in mixed-ploidy populations, both diploids and tetraploids usually persisted up to the last census.Conclusions Diploids and tetraploids commonly coexist at all spatial scales and exhibit considerable temporal stability in local ploidy mixtures. Mixed-ploidy populations containing fertile triploid hybrids probaby act as effective generators of cytogenetic novelty and may facilitate inter-ploidy gene flow. Neopolyploid mutants were incapable of local establishment.},

  abstract = {We present a new mechanistic model for predicting Septoria tritici blotch (STB) disease, parameterized with experimentally derived data for temperature- and wetness-dependent germination, growth and death of the causal agent, Zymoseptoria tritici. The output of this model (A) was compared with observed disease data for UK wheat over the period 2002\textendash 2016. In addition, we compared the output of a second model (B), in which experimentally derived parameters were replaced by a modified version of a published Z. tritici thermal performance equation, with the same observed disease data. Neither model predicted observed annual disease, but model A was able to differentiate UK regions with differing average disease risks over the entire period. The greatest limitations of both models are: broad spatial resolution of the climate data, and lack of host parameters. Model B is further limited by its lack of explicitly defined pathogen death, leading to a cumulative overestimation of disease over the course of the growing season. Comparison of models A and B demonstrates the importance of accounting for the temperature-dependency of pathogen processes important in the initiation and progression of disease. However, effective modelling of STB will probably require similar experimentally derived parameters for host and environmental factors, completing the disease triangle.This article is part of the theme issue `Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: approaches and important themes'. This issue is linked with the subsequent theme issue `Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: epidemic forecasting and control'.},

  abstract = {Humans are noisy. Indeed anthropogenic sounds are now almost ubiquitous throughout the land and seas [1]. Much recent work has focused on how noise affects the presence, abundance and behaviour of animals, either through directly harming animals or by making it difficult for them to communicate (e.g. [2]). A recently published study of Francis et al. [3] shows that anthropogenic noises may modify critical ecological services in a woodland eco-system and by doing so, expands the impact of noise into a new discipline\textemdash community ecology. Through a series of experiments, Francis et al. investi-gated the effect of noisy well compressors (which produce loud and continuous low-frequency noise) on the ecology of the surrounding ecosystem. Their goal was to deter-mine if noise pollution modified three critical ecological processes: pollination, seed dispersal and seed predation. The generalized hypothesis was that anthropogenic sound will repel or attract animals that provide these ecological services and the subsequent change in access to them will influence the surrounding flora. Results from the first experiment showed that the hummingbird pollinated plant Ipomopsis aggregata prob-ably experienced increased rates of pollination near anthropogenic sound because hummingbird pollinators (Archilochus alexandri) were more frequent around artifi-cial flowers at sites with compressor noise than those without, and that treatment sites had more pollen trans-fer. This demonstrated that the pollination of a plant could be affected indirectly if human noises increase the density of pollinators. The following two experiments investigated the effect of anthropogenic noise on pi\~n on pines (Pinus edulis), a dominant and an important tree in the New Mexico com-munity in which they worked. Seedling surveys showed that pine seedling recruitment was four times as abundant in quiet areas than those with noisy well compressors. They identified two mechanisms to explain this. First, they found that compressor noise repelled scrub jays (Aphelocoma californica), a key seed disperser. Second, they found that compressor noise raised Peromyscus mice densities, effective seed predators. Together, this unsur-prisingly led to evidence of higher seed consumption around the noisy well compressors. They conclude that anthropogenic sound indirectly affected the seedling recruitment of a dominant primary producer, and thus could ultimately change the community structure. Taken together, these results are novel in two ways. First, we traditionally have observed humans altering the distribution of primary producers via changing consu-mer density (e.g. consumer removal [4]), by changing the distribution or abundance of resources (e.g. eutrophication [5]), or by directly manipulating their communities (e.g. overharvesting [6]). A prototypical example is that overharvesting of herbivores causes shifts from coral to algal dominance in coral reef ecosys-tems [4]. However, Francis et al. demonstrated that an extraneous unnatural stimulus, rather than the manipu-lation of natural processes, can change the distribution of a primary producer. Therefore, the study raises additional questions ripe for study. For instance, do other human-produced stimuli in other modalities (e.g. light, olfactory) unknowingly affect the community struc-ture of primary producers? We can easily imagine that light does but identifying how it works is an area that is wide open for the study. Second, while we have studied extensively the effect of anthropogenic noise on animals, because it interferes with their communication (e.g. call rate [7]), cognition (e.g. attention [8]) and exposure to predators (e.g. fora-ging efficiency [9]), Francis et al. have shown us that noise may modulate ecosystem services provided by ani-mals and thus may influence plant distribution and community structure. This is a compelling finding because it shows that our stimuli can have a cascading effect, rather than simply a singular one within an ecosys-tem, from the animals that perceive it directly to their primary producing communities. Ultimately, Francis et al. showed that we must con-tinue to analyse and investigate secondary effects of anthropogenic stimuli because they may be more wide-reaching than previously anticipated. It is important that we understand how our activities alter surrounding eco-systems, so that we can then better predict and manage the myriad unintended effects of a large and noisy human population.},

However, Francis et al. demonstrated that an extraneous unnatural stimulus, rather than the manipu-lation of natural processes, can change the distribution of a primary producer. Therefore, the study raises additional questions ripe for study. For instance, do other human-produced stimuli in other modalities (e.g. light, olfactory) unknowingly affect the community struc-ture of primary producers? We can easily imagine that light does but identifying how it works is an area that is wide open for the study. Second, while we have studied extensively the effect of anthropogenic noise on animals, because it interferes with their communication (e.g. call rate [7]), cognition (e.g. attention [8]) and exposure to predators (e.g. fora-ging efficiency [9]), Francis et al. have shown us that noise may modulate ecosystem services provided by ani-mals and thus may influence plant distribution and community structure. This is a compelling finding because it shows that our stimuli can have a cascading effect, rather than simply a singular one within an ecosys-tem, from the animals that perceive it directly to their primary producing communities. Ultimately, Francis et al. showed that we must con-tinue to analyse and investigate secondary effects of anthropogenic stimuli because they may be more wide-reaching than previously anticipated. It is important that we understand how our activities alter surrounding eco-systems, so that we can then better predict and manage the myriad unintended effects of a large and noisy human population.},

  abstract = {During a long evolutionary history across a range of environmental conditions in the Near East Fertile Crescent, wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum subsp. dicoccoides) has accumulated a wealth of genetic diversity and adaptations to multiple biotic and abiotic stress conditions. The joint effects of the domestication and subsequent selection in man-made agro-ecosystems have considerably reduced the genetic variation in cultivated crop species as compared to their wild progenitors. The wild emmer gene pool harbors a rich allelic repertoire for improving numerous agronomically important traits. A set of advanced wild emmer wheat introgression lines (ILs) was previously established on a bread wheat genetic background. It combines genetic diversity from the wild progenitor as well as the genetic background of the cultigen. Based on field evaluations, the set of ILs (divided hierarchically into different families based on the genetic background) has exhibited high phenotypic variance in agronomically important traits. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) have shown that the effect of the hierarchical genetic factors was significant in the vast majority of the traits. Similarly, characterizations by molecular markers of known traits have shown that the genetic profile differs between ILs from different genetic backgrounds. Multivariate principal component analysis has revealed interesting associations between vegetative and reproductive traits and illustrated the impact of some of these traits on ILs distribution in the PC1 and PC2. The exploitation of the wild emmer wheat ILs as a tool for reintroduction of alleles that were lost during domestication and possible implications for wheat breeding are discussed.},

  abstract = {The Myxozoa comprise over 2,000 species of microscopic obligate parasites that use both invertebrate and vertebrate hosts as part of their life cycle. Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoans has been elusive, a close relationship with cnidarians, a group that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the distinctive myxozoan structure, the polar capsule, is remarkably similar to the stinging structures (nematocysts) in cnidarians. To gain insight into the extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic endoparasite, we analyzed genomic and transcriptomic assemblies from two distantly related myxozoan species, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus cerebralis, and compared these to the transcriptome and genome of the less reduced cnidarian parasite, Polypodium hydriforme. A phylogenomic analysis, using for the first time to our knowledge, a taxonomic sampling that represents the breadth of myxozoan diversity, including four newly generated myxozoan assemblies, confirms that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister taxon to P. hydriforme. Estimations of genome size reveal that myxozoans have one of the smallest reported animal genomes. Gene enrichment analyses show depletion of expressed genes in categories related to development, cell differentiation, and cell-cell communication. In addition, a search for candidate genes indicates that myxozoans lack key elements of signaling pathways and transcriptional factors important for multicellular development. Our results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasitic cnidarian was accompanied by extreme reduction in genome size and gene content.},

In this study, we investigated the molecular basis of the evolutionary events observed at this locus by comparing corresponding sequences of diploid, tertraploid, and hexaploid wheat species (Triticum and Aegilops). Genomic rearrangements, such as transposable element insertions, genomic deletions, duplications, and inversions, were shown to constitute the major differences when the same genomes (i.e., the A, B, or D genomes) were compared between species of different ploidy levels. The comparative analysis allowed us to determine the extent and sequences of the rearranged regions as well as rearrangement breakpoints and sequence motifs at their boundaries, which suggest rearrangement by illegitimate recombination. Among these genomic rearrangements, the previously reported Pina and Pinb genes loss from the Ha locus of polyploid wheat species was caused by a large genomic deletion that probably occurred independently in the A and B genomes. Moreover, the Ha locus in the D genome of hexaploid wheat (T. aestivum) is 29 kb smaller than in the D genome of its diploid progenitor Ae. tauschii, principally because of transposable element insertions and two large deletions caused by illegitimate recombination. Our data suggest that illegitimate DNA recombination, leading to various genomic rearrangements, constitutes one of the major evolutionary mechanisms in wheat species.},

  abstract = {Wheat was one of the first crops to be domesticated more than 10,000 years ago in the Middle East. Molecular genetics and archaeological data have allowed the reconstruction of plausible domestication scenarios leading to modern cultivars. For diploid einkorn and tetraploid durum wheat, a single domestication event has likely occurred in the Karacadag Mountains, Turkey. Following a cross between tetraploid durum and diploid T.~tauschii, the resultant hexaploid bread wheat was domesticated and disseminated around the Caucasian region. These polyploidisation events facilitated wheat domestication and created genetic bottlenecks, which excluded potentially adaptive alleles. With the urgent need to accelerate genetic progress to confront the challenges of climate change and sustainable agriculture, wild ancestors and old landraces represent a reservoir of underexploited genetic diversity that may be utilized through modern breeding methods. Understanding domestication processes may thus help identifying new strategies. R\'esum\'e Le bl\'e fut la premi\`ere esp\`ece domestiqu\'ee au Moyen-Orient, voici plus de 10~000~ans.

It may be caused by a partial lethal-factor acting in the filial generations. A method is presented for estimating the recombination values between a partial lethal-factor locus and a linked molecular marker and the relative viability or fertilization ability of zygotes or gametes, respectively affected by the partial lethal factor in backcross (BC) and doubled-haploid (DH) populations using the maximum-likelihood method associated with the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The method was applied to segregation data of molecular markers for a population of 150 DH lines developed from the `Steptoe'\texttimes `Morex' cross in barley. The presence of a partial lethal-factor locus, located on chromosome 4, causing partial selection was suggested. This locus was tightly linked to the ABG500B marker, and the chance of fertilization of female gametes possessing the partial lethal factor was, on average, 59.8\% that of a normal one. Two additional partial lethal factors were found on chromosome 5.},

  abstract = {Fungal effectors of wheat stem rust The fungal pathogen Ug99 (named for its identification in Uganda in 1999) threatens wheat crops worldwide. Ug99 can kill entire fields of wheat and is undeterred by many of the disease-resistance genes that otherwise protect wheat crops. Two papers describe two peptides secreted by the fungus as it attacks the wheat (see the Perspective by Moscou and van Esse). Chen et al. show that fungal AvrSr50 binds to the plant's immune receptor Sr50, and Salcedo et al. show that fungal AvrSr35 binds to Sr35. Successful binding activates the plant's immune defenses. Removing or inactivating these Avr effectors leaves the plant defenseless and susceptible to disease. Science, this issue p. 1607, p. 1604; see also p. 1541 Race-specific resistance genes protect the global wheat crop from stem rust disease caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) but are often overcome owing to evolution of new virulent races of the pathogen. To understand virulence evolution in Pgt, we identified the protein ligand (AvrSr50) recognized by the Sr50 resistance protein. A spontaneous mutant of Pgt virulent to Sr50 contained a 2.5 mega\textendash base pair loss-of-heterozygosity event. A haustorial secreted protein from this region triggers Sr50-dependent defense responses in planta and interacts directly with the Sr50 protein. Virulence alleles of AvrSr50 have arisen through DNA insertion and sequence divergence, and our data provide molecular evidence that in addition to sexual recombination, somatic exchange can play a role in the emergence of new virulence traits in Pgt. Fungal genes encode factors that interact with receptors in the wheat host to trigger resistance to disease.

Described and previously known from only one male specimen, this genus of predaceous katydids resembles spiders in their general body appearance. To call distant females, male katydids produce songs by stridulation where one forewing possessing a sclerotized file rubs against a row of teeth (scraper) on the other wing. In most katydid species, the songs are produced during the wing-closing phase of the stridulation. Morphological comparative studies of the stridulatory apparatus of the type specimen of Arachnoscelis arachnoides and males of other closely related species suggest that this insect sings with a frequency of ca. 80 kHz to attract conspecific females. We found an abundant population of A. arachnoides in Central Northeast of Colombia and undertook a complete analysis of the biomechanics of stridulation in this species. Using ultrasound-sensitive equipment and high-speed video, we determined that male A. arachnoides sing at ca. 74 kHz and use elastic energy and wing deformation to reach such ultrasonic frequencies. In contrast to most katydids, males of this species produce their calls during the opening phase of the wing; this form of stridulation is discussed.

  abstract = {Summary During meiosis homologous chromosomes pair and undergo reciprocal genetic exchange, termed crossover. Meiotic recombination has a profound effect on patterns of genetic variation and is an important tool during crop breeding. Crossovers initiate from programmed DNA double?stranded breaks that are processed to form single?stranded DNA, which can invade a homologous chromosome. Strand invasion events mature into double Holliday junctions that can be resolved as crossovers. Extensive variation in the frequency of meiotic recombination occurs along chromosomes and is typically focused in narrow hotspots, observed both at the level of DNA breaks and final crossovers. We review methodologies to profile hotspots at different steps of the meiotic recombination pathway that have been used in different eukaryote species. We then discuss what these studies have revealed concerning specification of hotspot locations and activity and the contributions of both genetic and epigenetic factors. Understanding hotspots is important for interpreting patterns of genetic variation in populations and how eukaryotic genomes evolve. In addition, manipulation of hotspots will allow us to accelerate crop breeding, where meiotic recombination distributions can be limiting.},

The aims of the study were to reveal: (1) evolutionary lineages of the diploid taxa and their genetic differentiation; (2) the past distribution of the rediscovered `Mediterranean diploid'; and (3) possible migration routes of diploids in the Mediterranean.Methods A combined approach involving sequencing of two plastid regions (trnL-trnF and rpl32-trnL), nrDNA ITS, rDNA FISH analyses, climatic niche characterization and spatio-temporal modelling was used.Key Results Among the examined diploid species, only two well-differentiated evolutionary lineages were recognized: Anthoxanthum gracile and A. alpinum. The other taxa \textendash{} A. aristatum, A. ovatum, A. maderense and the `Mediterranean diploid' \textendash{} form a rather intermixed group based on the examined molecular data. In situ rDNA localization enabled identification of the ancestral Anthoxanthum karyotype, shared by A. gracile and two taxa from the crown group. For the studied taxa, ancestral location probabilities for six discrete geographical regions in the Mediterranean were proposed and likely scenarios of gradual expansion from them were suggested. Modelling past and present distributions shows that the `Mediterranean diploid' has already been occurring in the same localities for 120\,000 years.Conclusions Highly congruent results were obtained and dated the origin and first diversification of Anthoxanthum to the Miocene. The later divergence probably took place in the Pleistocene and started polyploid evolution within the genus. The most recent diversification event is still occurring, and incomplete lineage sorting prevents full diversification of taxa at the molecular level, despite clear separation based on climatic niches. The `Mediterranean diploid' is hypothesized to be a possible relic of the most recent common ancestor of Anthoxanthum due to their sharing of ancestral features.},

  abstract = {Background and AimsThe genetic basis of increased rooting below the plough layer, post-anthesis in the field, of an elite wheat line (Triticum aestivum `Shamrock') with recent introgression from wild emmer (T. dicoccoides), is investigated. Shamrock has a non-glaucous canopy phenotype mapped to the short arm of chromosome 2B (2BS), derived from the wild emmer. A secondary aim was to determine whether genetic effects found in the field could have been predicted by other assessment methods.MethodsRoots of doubled haploid (DH) lines from a winter wheat (`Shamrock' \texttimes{} `Shango') population were assessed using a seedling screen in moist paper rolls, in rhizotrons to the end of tillering, and in the field post-anthesis. A linkage map was produced using single nucleotide polymorphism markers to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for rooting traits.Key ResultsShamrock had greater root length density (RLD) at depth than Shango, in the field and within the rhizotrons. The DH population exhibited diversity for rooting traits within the three environments studied. QTLs were identified on chromosomes 5D, 6B and 7B, explaining variation in RLD post-anthesis in the field. Effects associated with the non-glaucous trait on RLD interacted significantly with depth in the field, and some of this interaction mapped to 2BS. The effect of genotype was strongly influenced by the method of root assessment, e.g. glaucousness expressed in the field was negatively associated with root length in the rhizotrons, but positively associated with length in the seedling screen.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first study to identify QTLs for rooting at depth in field-grown wheat at mature growth stages. Within the population studied here, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that some of the variation in rooting is associated with recent introgression from wild emmer. The expression of genetic effects differed between the methods of root assessment.},

  abstract = {Nepenthes pitcher plants are typically carnivorous, producing pitchers with varying combinations of epicuticular wax crystals, viscoelastic fluids and slippery peristomes to trap arthropod prey, especially ants. However, ant densities are low in tropical montane habitats, thereby limiting the potential benefits of the carnivorous syndrome. Nepenthes lowii, a montane species from Borneo, produces two types of pitchers that differ greatly in form and function. Pitchers produced by immature plants conform to the 'typical' Nepenthes pattern, catching arthropod prey. However, pitchers produced by mature N. lowii plants lack the features associated with carnivory and are instead visited by tree shrews, which defaecate into them after feeding on exudates that accumulate on the pitcher lid. We tested the hypothesis that tree shrew faeces represent a significant nitrogen (N) source for N. lowii, finding that it accounts for between 57 and 100 per cent of foliar N in mature N. lowii plants. Thus, N. lowii employs a diversified N sequestration strategy, gaining access to a N source that is not available to sympatric congeners. The interaction between N. lowii and tree shrews appears to be a mutualism based on the exchange of food sources that are scarce in their montane habitat.},

However, it is now generally held that the early Earth's atmosphere was likely not reducing, but was dominated by N(2) and CO(2). The synthesis of organic compounds by the action of electric discharges on neutral gas mixtures has been shown to be much less efficient. We show here that contrary to previous reports, significant amounts of amino acids are produced from neutral gas mixtures. The low yields previously reported appear to be the outcome of oxidation of the organic compounds during hydrolytic workup by nitrite and nitrate produced in the reactions. The yield of amino acids is greatly increased when oxidation inhibitors, such as ferrous iron, are added prior to hydrolysis. Organic synthesis from neutral atmospheres may have depended on the oceanic availability of oxidation inhibitors as well as on the nature of the primitive atmosphere itself. The results reported here suggest that endogenous synthesis from neutral atmospheres may be more important than previously thought.},

  abstract = {In cooperatively breeding vertebrates, nonbreeding helpers raise young produced by dominant breeders. Although the evolution of cooperative breeding has often been attributed primarily to kin selection (whereby individuals gain "indirect" benefits to their fitness by assisting collateral relatives), there is increasing evidence that helpers can be unrelated to the young they are raising. Recent studies also suggest that the indirect benefits of cooperative behavior may often have been overestimated while the direct benefits of helping to the helper's own fitness have probably been underestimated. It now seems likely that the evolutionary mechanisms maintaining cooperative breeding are diverse and that, in some species, the direct benefits of helping may be sufficient to maintain cooperative societies. The benefits of cooperation in vertebrate societies may consequently show parallels with those in human societies, where cooperation between unrelated individuals is frequent and social institutions are often maintained by generalized reciprocity.},

  abstract = {Insights from the annotated wheat genome Wheat is one of the major sources of food for much of the world. However, because bread wheat's genome is a large hybrid mix of three separate subgenomes, it has been difficult to produce a high-quality reference sequence. Using recent advances in sequencing, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium presents an annotated reference genome with a detailed analysis of gene content among subgenomes and the structural organization for all the chromosomes. Examples of quantitative trait mapping and CRISPR-based genome modification show the potential for using this genome in agricultural research and breeding. Ram\'irez-Gonz\'alez et al. exploited the fruits of this endeavor to identify tissue-specific biased gene expression and coexpression networks during development and exposure to stress. These resources will accelerate our understanding of the genetic basis of bread wheat. Science, this issue p. eaar7191; see also p. eaar6089 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONWheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the most widely cultivated crop on Earth, contributing about a fifth of the total calories consumed by humans. Consequently, wheat yields and production affect the global economy, and failed harvests can lead to social unrest. Breeders continuously strive to develop improved varieties by fine-tuning genetically complex yield and end-use quality parameters while maintaining stable yields and adapting the crop to regionally specific biotic and abiotic stresses. RATIONALEBreeding efforts are limited by insufficient knowledge and understanding of wheat biology and the molecular basis of central agronomic traits. To meet the demands of human population growth, there is an urgent need for wheat research and breeding to accelerate genetic gain as well as to increase and protect wheat yield and quality traits. In other plant and animal species, access to a fully annotated and ordered genome sequence, including regulatory sequences and genome-diversity information, has promoted the development of systematic and more time-efficient approaches for the selection and understanding of important traits. Wheat has lagged behind, primarily owing to the challenges of assembling a genome that is more than five times as large as the human genome, polyploid, and complex, containing more than 85\% repetitive DNA. To provide a foundation for improvement through molecular breeding, in 2005, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium set out to deliver a high-quality annotated reference genome sequence of bread wheat. RESULTSAn annotated reference sequence representing the hexaploid bread wheat genome in the form of 21 chromosome-like sequence assemblies has now been delivered, giving access to 107,891 high-confidence genes, including their genomic context of regulatory sequences. This assembly enabled the discovery of tissue- and developmental stage\textendash related gene coexpression networks using a transcriptome atlas representing all stages of wheat development. The dynamics of change in complex gene families involved in environmental adaptation and end-use quality were revealed at subgenome resolution and contextualized to known agronomic single-gene or quantitative trait loci. Aspects of the future value of the annotated assembly for molecular breeding and research were exemplarily illustrated by resolving the genetic basis of a quantitative trait locus conferring resistance to abiotic stress and insect damage as well as by serving as the basis for genome editing of the flowering-time trait. CONCLUSIONThis annotated reference sequence of wheat is a resource that can now drive disruptive innovation in wheat improvement, as this community resource establishes the foundation for accelerating wheat research and application through improved understanding of wheat biology and genomics-assisted breeding. Importantly, the bioinformatics capacity developed for model-organism genomes will facilitate a better understanding of the wheat genome as a result of the high-quality chromosome-based genome assembly. By necessity, breeders work with the genome at the whole chromosome level, as each new cross involves the modification of genome-wide gene networks that control the expression of complex traits such as yield. With the annotated and ordered reference genome sequence in place, researchers and breeders can now easily access sequence-level information to precisely define the necessary changes in the genomes for breeding programs. This will be realized through the implementation of new DNA marker platforms and targeted breeding technologies, including genome editing. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/361/6403/eaar7191/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Wheat genome deciphered, assembled, and ordered.Seeds, or grains, are what counts with respect to wheat yields (left panel), but all parts of the plant contribute to crop performance. With complete access to the ordered sequence of all 21 wheat chromosomes, the context of regulatory sequences, and the interaction network of expressed genes\textemdash all shown here as a circular plot (right panel) with concentric tracks for diverse aspects of wheat genome composition\textemdash breeders and researchers now have the ability to rewrite the story of wheat crop improvement. Details on value ranges underlying the concentric heatmaps of the right panel are provided in the full article online. An annotated reference sequence representing the hexaploid bread wheat genome in 21 pseudomolecules has been analyzed to identify the distribution and genomic context of coding and noncoding elements across the A, B, and D subgenomes. With an estimated coverage of 94\% of the genome and containing 107,891 high-confidence gene models, this assembly enabled the discovery of tissue- and developmental stage\textendash related coexpression networks by providing a transcriptome atlas representing major stages of wheat development. Dynamics of complex gene families involved in environmental adaptation and end-use quality were revealed at subgenome resolution and contextualized to known agronomic single-gene or quantitative trait loci. This community resource establishes the foundation for accelerating wheat research and application through improved understanding of wheat biology and genomics-assisted breeding. The 21 annotated chromosomes of bread wheat provide a foundation for innovation in research and breeding.

  abstract = {Insights from the annotated wheat genome Wheat is one of the major sources of food for much of the world. However, because bread wheat's genome is a large hybrid mix of three separate subgenomes, it has been difficult to produce a high-quality reference sequence. Using recent advances in sequencing, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium presents an annotated reference genome with a detailed analysis of gene content among subgenomes and the structural organization for all the chromosomes. Examples of quantitative trait mapping and CRISPR-based genome modification show the potential for using this genome in agricultural research and breeding. Ram\'irez-Gonz\'alez et al. exploited the fruits of this endeavor to identify tissue-specific biased gene expression and coexpression networks during development and exposure to stress. These resources will accelerate our understanding of the genetic basis of bread wheat. Science, this issue p. eaar7191; see also p. eaar6089 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONWheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the most widely cultivated crop on Earth, contributing about a fifth of the total calories consumed by humans. Consequently, wheat yields and production affect the global economy, and failed harvests can lead to social unrest. Breeders continuously strive to develop improved varieties by fine-tuning genetically complex yield and end-use quality parameters while maintaining stable yields and adapting the crop to regionally specific biotic and abiotic stresses. RATIONALEBreeding efforts are limited by insufficient knowledge and understanding of wheat biology and the molecular basis of central agronomic traits. To meet the demands of human population growth, there is an urgent need for wheat research and breeding to accelerate genetic gain as well as to increase and protect wheat yield and quality traits. In other plant and animal species, access to a fully annotated and ordered genome sequence, including regulatory sequences and genome-diversity information, has promoted the development of systematic and more time-efficient approaches for the selection and understanding of important traits. Wheat has lagged behind, primarily owing to the challenges of assembling a genome that is more than five times as large as the human genome, polyploid, and complex, containing more than 85\% repetitive DNA. To provide a foundation for improvement through molecular breeding, in 2005, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium set out to deliver a high-quality annotated reference genome sequence of bread wheat. RESULTSAn annotated reference sequence representing the hexaploid bread wheat genome in the form of 21 chromosome-like sequence assemblies has now been delivered, giving access to 107,891 high-confidence genes, including their genomic context of regulatory sequences. This assembly enabled the discovery of tissue- and developmental stage\textendash related gene coexpression networks using a transcriptome atlas representing all stages of wheat development. The dynamics of change in complex gene families involved in environmental adaptation and end-use quality were revealed at subgenome resolution and contextualized to known agronomic single-gene or quantitative trait loci. Aspects of the future value of the annotated assembly for molecular breeding and research were exemplarily illustrated by resolving the genetic basis of a quantitative trait locus conferring resistance to abiotic stress and insect damage as well as by serving as the basis for genome editing of the flowering-time trait. CONCLUSIONThis annotated reference sequence of wheat is a resource that can now drive disruptive innovation in wheat improvement, as this community resource establishes the foundation for accelerating wheat research and application through improved understanding of wheat biology and genomics-assisted breeding. Importantly, the bioinformatics capacity developed for model-organism genomes will facilitate a better understanding of the wheat genome as a result of the high-quality chromosome-based genome assembly. By necessity, breeders work with the genome at the whole chromosome level, as each new cross involves the modification of genome-wide gene networks that control the expression of complex traits such as yield. With the annotated and ordered reference genome sequence in place, researchers and breeders can now easily access sequence-level information to precisely define the necessary changes in the genomes for breeding programs. This will be realized through the implementation of new DNA marker platforms and targeted breeding technologies, including genome editing. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/361/6403/eaar7191/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Wheat genome deciphered, assembled, and ordered.Seeds, or grains, are what counts with respect to wheat yields (left panel), but all parts of the plant contribute to crop performance. With complete access to the ordered sequence of all 21 wheat chromosomes, the context of regulatory sequences, and the interaction network of expressed genes\textemdash all shown here as a circular plot (right panel) with concentric tracks for diverse aspects of wheat genome composition\textemdash breeders and researchers now have the ability to rewrite the story of wheat crop improvement. Details on value ranges underlying the concentric heatmaps of the right panel are provided in the full article online. An annotated reference sequence representing the hexaploid bread wheat genome in 21 pseudomolecules has been analyzed to identify the distribution and genomic context of coding and noncoding elements across the A, B, and D subgenomes. With an estimated coverage of 94\% of the genome and containing 107,891 high-confidence gene models, this assembly enabled the discovery of tissue- and developmental stage\textendash related coexpression networks by providing a transcriptome atlas representing major stages of wheat development.

  abstract = {Social-information use has generated great interest lately and has been shown to have important implications for the ecology and evolution of species [1-6]. Learning about predators or predation risk from others may provide low-cost life-saving information and would be expected to have adaptive payoffs in any species where conspecifics are observable and behave differently under predation risk. Yet, social learning and social-information use in general have been largely restricted to vertebrates ([1-3, 5, 7-9], but see [10-16]). Here, we show that crickets adapt their predator-avoidance behavior after having observed the behavior of knowledgeable others and maintain these behavioral changes lastingly after demonstrators are gone. These results point toward social learning, a contingency never shown before in noncolonial insects. We show that these long-lasting changes cannot instead be attributed to long re-emergence times, long-lasting effects of alarm pheromones, or residual odor cues. Our findings imply that social learning is likely much more phylogenetically widespread than currently acknowledged and that reliance on social information is determined by ecological rather than taxonomic constrains [17, 18], and they question the generally held assumption that social learning is restricted to large-brained animals assumed to possess superior cognitive abilities. \textcopyright 2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

This paper provides a critical analysis of methodologies for bypassing wheat's genetic bottleneck and deepening its primary gene pool. It emphasizes the two general approaches to expanding the wheat gene pool: amphiploidization and direct backcrossing. Advantages and disadvantages of both methodologies are provided, drawing on examples of gene transfer from the various subspecies of T. monococcum, T. urartu, T. turgidum, T. timopheevii, ssp. monococcum, Ae. speltoides, and Ae. tauschii.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of cross-transmission and hybridization between parasites of humans and reservoir hosts is critical for understanding the evolution of the parasite and for implementing control programmes. There is now a consensus that populations of pig and human Ascaris (roundworms) show significant genetic subdivision. However, it is unclear whether this has resulted from a single or multiple host shift(s). Furthermore, previous molecular data have not been sufficient to determine whether sympatric populations of human and pig Ascaris can exchange genes. To disentangle patterns of host colonization and hybridization, we used 23 microsatellite loci to conduct Bayesian clustering analyses of individual worms collected from pigs and humans. We observed strong differentiation between populations which was primarily driven by geography, with secondary differentiation resulting from host affiliation within locations. This pattern is consistent with multiple host colonization events. However, there is low support for the short internal branches of the dendrograms. In part, the relationships among clusters may result from current hybridization among sympatric human and pig roundworms. Indeed, congruence in three Bayesian methods indicated that 4 and 7\% of roundworms sampled from Guatemala and China, respectively, were hybrids. These results indicate that there is contemporary cross-transmission between populations of human and pig Ascaris.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of cross-transmission and hybridization between parasites of humans and reservoir hosts is critical for understanding the evolution of the parasite and for implementing control programmes. There is now a consensus that populations of pig and human Ascaris (roundworms) show significant genetic subdivision. However, it is unclear whether this has resulted from a single or multiple host shift(s). Furthermore, previous molecular data have not been sufficient to determine whether sympatric populations of human and pig Ascaris can exchange genes. To disentangle patterns of host colonization and hybridization, we used 23 microsatellite loci to conduct Bayesian clustering analyses of individual worms collected from pigs and humans. We observed strong differentiation between populations which was primarily driven by geography, with secondary differentiation resulting from host affiliation within locations. This pattern is consistent with multiple host colonization events. However, there is low support for the short internal branches of the dendrograms. In part, the relationships among clusters may result from current hybridization among sympatric human and pig roundworms. Indeed, congruence in three Bayesian methods indicated that 4 and 7\% of roundworms sampled from Guatemala and China, respectively, were hybrids. These results indicate that there is contemporary cross-transmission between populations of human and pig Ascaris.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims To provide additional information to the many phylogenetic analyses conducted within Hordeum, here the origin and interspecific affinities of the allotetraploids Hordeum secalinum and Hordeum capense were analysed by molecular karyotyping. Methods Karyotypes were determined using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) to distinguish the sub-genomes Xa and I, plus fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)/non-denaturing (ND)-FISH to determine the distribution of ten tandem repetitive DNA sequences and thus provide chromosome markers. Key Results Each chromosome pair in the six accessions analysed was identified, allowing the establishment of homologous and putative homeologous relationships. The low-level polymorphism observed among the H. secalinum accessions contrasted with the divergence recorded for the sub-genome Xa of the H. capense accessions. Although accession H335 carries an intergenomic translocation, its chromosome structure was indistinguishable from that of H. secalinum. ConclusionHordeum secalinum and H. capense accession H335 share a hybrid origin involving Hordeum marinum subsp. gussoneanum as the Xa genome donor and an unidentified I genome progenitor. Hordeum capense accession BCC2062 either diverged, with remodelling of the Xa sub-genome, or its Xa genome was donated by a now extinct ancestor. A scheme of probable evolution shows the intricate pattern of relationships among the Hordeum species carrying the Xa genome (including all H. marinum taxa and the hexaploid Hordeum brachyantherum).},

Eleven C-bands and two seed storage protein genes on chromosome 1B, polymorphic between Langdon durum and four accessions of T. dicoccoides, were used to study the distribution of recombination along the entire length of the chromosome. Recombination in the short arm was almost completely restricted to the satellite, two-thirds of the arm's length from the centromere; the Gli-B1 gene was found to be tightly linked to the telomeric C-band. In the long arm, the distal 51.4\% of the arm accounted for 88\% of recombination; the proximal half of the arm accounted for the remaining 12\%. While the amount of crossing-over differed significantly between the four T. dicoccoides 1B chromosomes, there were no significant differences in the relative distributions of crossing-over along the chromosome. Consequently, the genetic maps obtained from the four individual T. dicoccoides chromosomes were combined to yield a consensus map of 14 markers (including the centromere) for the chromosome.},

While the electroreceptors in fish and amphibians evolved from mechanosensory lateral line organs, those of monotremes are based on cutaneous glands innervated by trigeminal nerves. Electroreceptors evolved from other structures or in other taxa were unknown to date. Here we show that the hairless vibrissal crypts on the rostrum of the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), structures originally associated with the mammalian whiskers, serve as electroreceptors. Histological investigations revealed that the vibrissal crypts possess a well-innervated ampullary structure reminiscent of ampullary electroreceptors in other species. Psychophysical experiments with a male Guiana dolphin determined a sensory detection threshold for weak electric fields of 4.6 \textmu V cm(-1), which is comparable to the sensitivity of electroreceptors in platypuses. Our results show that electroreceptors can evolve from a mechanosensory organ that nearly all mammals possess and suggest the discovery of this kind of electroreception in more species, especially those with an aquatic or semi-aquatic lifestyle.},

The resultant informatics problems have a profound impact on analysis and interpretation the data. Here, we address these critical issues and offer a solution.

We then reorganized probes on more than a dozen popular GeneChips into gene-, transcript- and exon-specific probe sets in light of up-to-date genome, cDNA/EST clustering and single nucleotide polymorphism information. Comparing analysis results between the original and the redefined probe sets reveals {$\sim$}30\textendash 50\% discrepancy in the genes previously identified as differentially expressed, regardless of analysis method. Our results demonstrate that the original Affymetrix probe set definitions are inaccurate, and many conclusions derived from past GeneChip analyses may be significantly flawed.

  abstract = {Segregation distortion is commonly detected via genetic mapping and this phenomenon has been reported in many species. However, the genetic causes of the segregation distortion regions in a majority of species are still unclear. To genetically dissect the SD on chromosome 18 in cotton, eight reciprocal backcross populations and two F2 populations were developed. Eleven segregation distortion loci (SDL) were detected in these ten populations. Comparative analyses among populations revealed that SDL18.1 and SDL18.9 were consistent with male gametic competition; whereas SDL18.4 and SDL18.11 reflected female gametic selection. Similarly, other SDL could reflect zygotic selection. The surprising finding was that SDL18.8 was detected in all populations, and the direction was skewed towards heterozygotes. Consequently, zygotic selection or heterosis could represent the underlying genetic mechanism for SDL18.8. Among developed introgression lines, SDL18.8 was introgressed as a heterozygote, further substantiating that a heterozygote state was preferred under competition. Six out of 11 SDL on chromosome 18 were dependent on the cytoplasmic environment. These results indicated that different SDL showed varying responses to the cytoplasmic environment. Overall, the results provided a novel strategy to analyze the molecular mechanisms, which could be further exploited in cotton interspecific breeding programs.},

In bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), COs are mostly limited to subtelomeric regions of chromosomes, resulting in a substantial loss of breeding efficiency in the proximal regions, though these regions carry {$\sim$}60\textendash 70\% of the genes. Identifying sequence and/or chromosome features affecting recombination occurrence is thus relevant to improve and drive recombination. Using the recent release of a reference sequence of chromosome 3B and of the draft assemblies of the 20 other wheat chromosomes, we performed fine-scale mapping of COs and revealed that 82\% of COs located in the distal ends of chromosome 3B representing 19\% of the chromosome length. We used 774 SNPs to genotype 180 varieties representative of the Asian and European genetic pools and a segregating population of 1270 F6 lines. We observed a common location for ancestral COs (predicted through linkage disequilibrium) and the COs derived from the segregating population. We delineated 73 small intervals ({$<$}26 kb) on chromosome 3B that contained 252 COs. We observed a significant association of COs with genic features (73 and 54\% in recombinant and nonrecombinant intervals, respectively) and with those expressed during meiosis (67\% in recombinant intervals and 48\% in nonrecombinant intervals). Moreover, while the recombinant intervals contained similar amounts of retrotransposons and DNA transposons (42 and 53\%), nonrecombinant intervals had a higher level of retrotransposons (63\%) and lower levels of DNA transposons (28\%). Consistent with this, we observed a higher frequency of a DNA motif specific to the TIR-Mariner DNA transposon in recombinant intervals.},

  abstract = {A simulation study was carried out on a backcross population in order to determine the effect of marker spacing, gene effect and population size on the power of marker-quantitative trait loci (QTL) linkage experiments and on the standard error of maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of QTL gene effect and map location. Power of detecting a QTL was virtually the same for a marker spacing of 10 cM as for an infinite number of markers and was only slightly decreased for marker spacing of 20 or even 50 cM. The advantage of using interval mapping as compared to single-marker analysis was slight. "Resolving power" of a marker-QTL linkage experiment was defined as the 95\% confidence interval for the QTL map location that would be obtained when scoring an infinite number of markers. It was found that reducing marker spacing below the resolving power did not add appreciably to narrowing the confidence interval. Thus, the 95\% confidence interval with infinite markers sets the useful marker spacing for estimating QTL map location for a given population size and estimated gene effect.},

  abstract = {In most long-lived animal species, juveniles survive less well than adults. A potential mechanism is inferior foraging skills but longitudinal studies that follow the development of juvenile foraging are needed to test this. We used miniaturized activity loggers to record daily foraging times of juvenile and adult European shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis from fledging to the following spring. Juveniles became independent from their parents 40 days post-fledging. They compensated for poor foraging proficiency by foraging for approximately 3 h d(-1) longer than adults until constrained by day length in early November. Thereafter, juvenile foraging time tracked shortening day length up to the winter solstice, when foraging time of the two age classes converged and continued to track day length until early February. Few individuals died until midwinter and mortality peaked in January-February, with juvenile mortality (including some of the study birds) five times that of adults. In their last two weeks of life, juveniles showed a marked decline in foraging time consistent with individuals becoming moribund. Our results provide compelling evidence that juveniles compensate for poor foraging proficiency by increasing foraging time, a strategy that is limited by day length resulting in high winter mortality.},

  abstract = {The hy1 mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana fail to make the phytochrome-chromophore phytochromobilin and therefore are deficient in a wide range of phytochrome-mediated responses. Because this defect can be rescued by feeding seedlings biliverdin IXalpha, it is likely that the mutations affect an enzyme that converts heme to this phytochromobilin intermediate. By a combination of positional cloning and candidate-gene isolation, we have identified the HY1 gene and found it to be related to cyanobacterial, algal, and animal heme oxygenases. Three independent alleles of hy1 contain DNA lesions within the HY1 coding region, and a genomic sequence spanning the HY1 locus complements the hy1-1 mutation. HY1 is a member of a gene family and is expressed in a variety of A. thaliana tissues. Based on its homology, we propose that HY1 encodes a higher-plant heme oxygenase, designated AtHO1, responsible for catalyzing the reaction that opens the tetrapyrrole ring of heme to generate biliverdin IXalpha.},

Solitary animals can sometimes learn from conspecifics [2, 3], and social learning abilities often correlate with individual learning abilities [4-6], so there may be little reason to view the underlying learning processes as adaptively specialized. Here, we demonstrate how learning by observation, an ability common to primates, birds, rodents, and insects [7-9], may arise through a simple Pavlovian ability to integrate two learned associations. Bumblebees are known to learn how to recognize rewarding flower colors by watching conspecifics from behind a screen [9], and we found that previous associations between conspecifics and reward are critical to this process. Bees that have previously been rewarded for joining conspecifics copy color preferences, but bees that lack such experience do not, and those that associate conspecifics with bitter substances actively avoid those flower colors where others have been seen. Our findings place a seemingly complex social learning phenomenon within a simple associative framework that is common to social and solitary species alike. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

As hybridization fuels genomic and transcriptional alterations, hybrids are adept to respond to environmental changes or to invade novel niches.

The latter group is especially well-known for engaging in everlasting arms races with their hosts. Illustrated by the increased identification of hybrid pathogens with altered virulence or host ranges when compared with their parental lineages, it appears that hybridization is a strong driver for pathogen evolution, and may thus significantly impact agriculture and natural ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Introduction The causal agents of Verticillium wilts are globally distributed pathogens that cause significant crop losses every year. Most Verticillium wilts are caused by V. dahliae, which is pathogenic on a broad range of plant hosts, whereas other pathogenic Verticillium species have more restricted host ranges. In contrast, V. longisporum appears to prefer brassicaceous plants and poses an increasing problem to oilseed rape production. Taxonomy Kingdom Fungi; Phylum Ascomycota; Class Sordariomycetes; Subclass Hypocreomycetida; Family Plectosphaerellaceae; genus Verticillium. Disease symptoms Dark unilateral stripes appear on the stems of apparently healthy looking oilseed rape plants at the end of the growing season. Microsclerotia are subsequently formed in the stem cortex beneath the epidermis. Genome Verticillium longisporum is the only non-haploid species in the Verticillium genus, as it is an amphidiploid hybrid that carries almost twice as much genetic material as the other Verticillium species as a result of interspecific hybridization. Disease management There is no effective fungicide treatment to control Verticillium diseases, and resistance breeding is the preferred strategy for disease management. However, only a few Verticillium wilt resistance genes have been identified, and monogenic resistance against V. longisporum has not yet been found. Quantitative resistance exists mainly in the Brassica C-genome of parental cabbage lines and may be introgressed in oilseed rape breeding lines. Common name Oilseed rape colonized by V. longisporum does not develop wilting symptoms, and therefore the common name of Verticillium wilt is unsuitable for this crop. Therefore, we propose `Verticillium stem striping' as the common name for Verticillium infections of oilseed rape.},

Molecular approaches to phylogenetics have proven able to revolutionize our knowledge of organismal evolution. However, with respect to the deepest splits in the metazoan Tree of Life-the relationships between Bilateria and the four non-bilaterian phyla (Porifera, Placozoa, Ctenophora, and Cnidaria)-no consensus has been reached yet, since a number of different, often contradictory, hypotheses with sometimes spectacular implications have been proposed in recent years. Here, we review the recent literature on the topic and contrast it with more classical perceptions based on analyses of morphological characters. We conclude that the time is not yet ripe to rewrite zoological textbooks and advocate a conservative approach when it comes to developing scenarios of the early evolution of animals.},

  abstract = {The genetic basis of variation in recombination in higher plants is polygenic and poorly understood, despite its theoretical and practical importance. Here a method of detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing recombination in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) is proposed that relies upon the fact that genotype data within RILs carry the signature of past recombination. Behavior of the segregational genetic variance in numbers of chromosomal crossovers (recombination) over generations is described for self-, full-sib-, and half-sib-generated RILs with no dominance in true crossovers. This genetic variance, which as a fraction of the total phenotypic variance contributes to the statistical power of the method, was asymptotically greatest with half sibbing, less with sibbing, and least with selfing. The statistical power to detect a recombination QTL declined with diminishing QTL effect, genome target size, and marker density. For reasonably tight marker linkage power was greater with less intense inbreeding for later generations and vice versa for early generations. Generational optima for segregation variance and statistical power were found, whose onset and narrowness varied with marker density and mating design, being more pronounced for looser marker linkage. Application of this method to a maize RIL population derived from inbred lines Mo17 and B73 and developed by selfing suggested two putative QTL (LOD {$>$} 2.4) affecting certain chromosomes, and using a canonical transformation another putative QTL was detected. However, permutation tests failed to support their presence (experimentwise {$\alpha$} = 0.05). Other populations with more statistical power and chosen specifically for recombination QTL segregation would be more effective.},

However, nutrients are abstract constructs of modern science, so how can we expect primates to know what they are? To argue that a foraging primate is avoiding fiber or searching for a particular nutrient class such as protein, we have to establish a sensory link to these abstract food components. This review synthesizes widely scattered information on the sensory ecology of primates and asks how the senses might convey information on food location, abundance, and quality. Primates receive a barrage of sensory inputs, which help them make efficient feeding decisions about food distributed in time and space. We do not treat these senses in a traditional manner, but divide them into those that receive input from outside the animal (external senses) and from inside the digestive system (internal senses). We treat less completely some areas that have been reviewed in past issues of Evolutionary Anthropology, such as color vision, taste, and food physics.},

We have bred the great tit (Parus major), a classical model species for the study of behaviour under natural conditions, in captivity. Here, we report a realized heritability of 54 +/- 5\% for early exploratory behaviour, based on four generations of bi-directional artificial selection. In addition to this, we measured hand-reared juveniles and their wild-caught parents in the laboratory. The heritability found in the mid-offspring-mid-parent regression was significantly different from zero.

  abstract = {Background Recombination rate is an essential parameter for many genetic analyses. Recombination rates are highly variable across species, populations, individuals and different genomic regions. Due to the profound influence that recombination can have on intraspecific diversity and interspecific divergence, characterization of recombination rate variation emerges as a key resource for population genomic studies and emphasises the importance of high-density genetic maps as tools for studying genome biology. Here we present such a high-density genetic map for Daphnia magna, and analyse patterns of recombination rate across the genome. Results A F2 intercross panel was genotyped by Restriction-site Associated DNA sequencing to construct the third-generation linkage map of D. magna. The resulting high-density map included 4037 markers covering 813 scaffolds and contigs that sum up to 77~\% of the currently available genome draft sequence (v2.4) and 55~\% of the estimated genome size (238~Mb). Total genetic length of the map presented here is 1614.5~cM and the genome-wide recombination rate is estimated to 6.78~cM/Mb. Merging genetic and physical information we consistently found that recombination rate estimates are high towards the peripheral parts of the chromosomes, while chromosome centres, harbouring centromeres in D. magna, show very low recombination rate estimates. Conclusions Due to its high-density, the third-generation linkage map for D. magna can be coupled with the draft genome assembly, providing an essential tool for genome investigation in this model organism. Thus, our linkage map can be used for the on-going improvements of the genome assembly, but more importantly, it has enabled us to characterize variation in recombination rate across the genome of D. magna for the first time. These new insights can provide a valuable assistance in future studies of the genome evolution, mapping of quantitative traits and population genetic studies.

  abstract = {Long-held ideas regarding the evolutionary relationships among animals have recently been upended by sometimes controversial hypotheses based largely on insights from molecular data. These new hypotheses include a clade of moulting animals (Ecdysozoa) and the close relationship of the lophophorates to molluscs and annelids (Lophotrochozoa). Many relationships remain disputed, including those that are required to polarize key features of character evolution, and support for deep nodes is often low. Phylogenomic approaches, which use data from many genes, have shown promise for resolving deep animal relationships, but are hindered by a lack of data from many important groups. Here we report a total of 39.9 Mb of expressed sequence tags from 29 animals belonging to 21 phyla, including 11 phyla previously lacking genomic or expressed-sequence-tag data. Analysed in combination with existing sequences, our data reinforce several previously identified clades that split deeply in the animal tree (including Protostomia, Ecdysozoa and Lophotrochozoa), unambiguously resolve multiple long-standing issues for which there was strong conflicting support in earlier studies with less data (such as velvet worms rather than tardigrades as the sister group of arthropods), and provide molecular support for the monophyly of molluscs, a group long recognized by morphologists. In addition, we find strong support for several new hypotheses. These include a clade that unites annelids (including sipunculans and echiurans) with nemerteans, phoronids and brachiopods, molluscs as sister to that assemblage, and the placement of ctenophores as the earliest diverging extant multicellular animals. A single origin of spiral cleavage (with subsequent losses) is inferred from well-supported nodes. Many relationships between a stable subset of taxa find strong support, and a diminishing number of lineages remain recalcitrant to placement on the tree.},

  abstract = {Metaphase I (MI) pairing of homologous chromosomes in wheat intercultivar hybrids (heterohomologous chromosomes) is usually reduced relative to that within the inbred parental cultivars (euhomologous chromosomes). It was proposed elsewhere that this phenomenon is caused by polymorphism in nucleotide sequences (nonstructural chromosome variation) among wheat cultivars. The distribution of this polymorphism along chromosome arm 6Bp (=6BS) of cultivars Chinese Spring and Cheyenne was investigated. A population of potentially recombinant chromosomes derived from crossing over between telosome 6Bp of Chinese Spring and Cheyenne chromosome 6B was developed in the isogenic background of Chinese Spring. The approximate length of the Chinese Spring segment present in each of these chromosomes was assessed by determining for each chromosome the interval in which crossing over occurred (utilizing the rRNA gene region, a distal C-band and the gliadin gene region as markers). The MI pairing frequencies of these chromosomes (only the complete chromosomes were used) with the normal Chinese Spring telosome 6Bp were determined. These were directly proportional to the length of the euhomologous segment. The longer the incorporated euhomologous segment the better was the MI pairing. This provided evidence that the heterohomologous chromosomes are differentiated from each other in numerous sites distributed throughout the arm.\textemdash The comparison of the physical map of arm 6Bp with the linkage map showed a remarkable distortion of the linkage map; no crossing over was detected in the proximal 68\% of the arm. A population of 49 recombinant chromosomes was assayed for recombination within the rRNA gene region, but none was detected. No new length variants of the nontranscribed spacer separating the 18S and 26S rRNA genes were detected either.},

Additionally, recombination was assessed for several chromosome regions, in arm 6Bq between the centromere and the BZ locus (awn suppressor) and in arm 6Bp between the centromere and Nor-B2, between Nor-BZ and a distal Cband and between Nor-BZ and Gli-BZ coding for gliadins. T h e experimental design permitted the distinction between crossing over between homologous chromosomes and exchange between sister chromatids. No homologous crossing over within the Nor-B2 locus was found in a sample of 446 chromosomes, but one exchange with the attributes of unequal sister chromatid exchange was identified. T h e molecular characteristics of this presumed sister chromatid exchange indicate that the spacer variants present in the Nor-BZ locus are clustered. No homologous recombination was detected within the distal Gli-B2 locus containing repeated genes coding for gliadin seed-storage proteins. Both arms of chromosome 6B showed low crossing-over frequency in the proximal regions. T h e distance from the centromere to Nor-BZ was only from 0.3 to 2.2 cM although it accounts for about two-thirds of the metaphase chromosome arm, which shows a great distortion of the metaphase map of the arm. T h e level of homologous recombination within the Nor-BZ locus is lower than in the chromosome region immediately distal to it. Whether it is comparable to that in the chromosome region proximal to it could not be determined. Recombination frequencies of different pairs of chromosome 6B in all but one interval paralleled the frequencies of their metaphase I pairing: Lower pairing a t metaphase I was paralleled by lower crossing-over frequency. This relationship indicated that reduced metaphase I pairing between 6B chromosomes from different populations is due to impaired crossing-over and not due to precocious chiasma terminalization.},

For small colour distances there was also significant linear correlations between accuracy and response time for the individual bees. The results show both between task and within task speed-accuracy tradeoffs in bees, which suggests the possibility of a sophisticated and dynamic decision-making process.},

However, many plants are also polyploid, and marker-assisted selection can be complicated by the presence of highly similar, but non-allelic, homoeologous sequences. Despite this, there is practical and academic demand for high-throughput genotyping in several polyploid crop species, such as allohexaploid wheat. In this paper, we present such a system, which utilizes public single nucleotide polymorphisms previously identified in both agronomically important genes and in randomly selected, mapped, expressed sequence tags developed by the wheat community. To achieve relatively high levels of multiplexing, we used non-amplified genomic DNA and padlock probe pairs, together with high annealing temperatures, to differentiate between similar sequences in the wheat genome. Our results suggest that padlock probes are capable of discriminating between homoeologous sequences and hence can be used to efficiently genotype wheat varieties.},

Anal fin egg-spots are such a male sexual signal and a key characteristic of the most species-rich group of cichlid fishes, the haplochromines. Males of about 1500 mouth-brooding species utilize these conspicuous egg-dummies during courtship\textendash apparently to attract females and to maximize fertilization success. Here we test the hypothesis that the evolution of haplochromine egg-spots was triggered by a pre-existing bias for eggs or egg-like coloration. To this end, we performed mate-choice experiments in the basal haplochromine Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor, which manifests the plesiomorphic character-state of an egg-spot-less anal fin. Experiments using computer-animated photographs of males indeed revealed that females prefer images of males with virtual ('in-silico') egg-spots over images showing unaltered males. In addition, we tested for color preferences (outside a mating context) in a phylogenetically representative set of East African cichlids. We uncovered a strong preference for yellow, orange or reddish spots in all haplochromines tested and, importantly, also in most other species representing more basal lines. This pre-existing female sensory bias points towards high-quality (carotenoids-enriched) food suggesting that it is adaptive.},

  abstract = {Carnivory has evolved independently at least six times in five angiosperm orders. In spite of these independent origins, there is a remarkable morphological convergence of carnivorous plant traps and physiological convergence of mechanisms for digesting and assimilating prey. These convergent traits have made carnivorous plants model systems for addressing questions in plant molecular genetics, physiology, and evolutionary ecology. New data show that carnivorous plant genera with morphologically complex traps have higher relative rates of gene substitutions than do those with simple sticky traps. This observation suggests two alternative mechanisms for the evolution and diversification of carnivorous plant lineages. The 'energetics hypothesis' posits rapid morphological evolution resulting from a few changes in regulatory genes responsible for meeting the high energetic demands of active traps. The 'predictable prey capture hypothesis' further posits that complex traps yield more predictable and frequent prey captures. To evaluate these hypotheses, available data on the tempo and mode of carnivorous plant evolution were reviewed; patterns of prey capture by carnivorous plants were analysed; and the energetic costs and benefits of botanical carnivory were re-evaluated. Collectively, the data are more supportive of the energetics hypothesis than the predictable prey capture hypothesis. The energetics hypothesis is consistent with a phenomenological cost-benefit model for the evolution of botanical carnivory, and also accounts for data suggesting that carnivorous plants have leaf construction costs and scaling relationships among leaf traits that are substantially different from those of non-carnivorous plants.},

  abstract = {Advances in next generation technologies have driven the costs of DNA sequencing down to the point that genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is now feasible for high diversity, large genome species. Here, we report a procedure for constructing GBS libraries based on reducing genome complexity with restriction enzymes (REs). This approach is simple, quick, extremely specific, highly reproducible, and may reach important regions of the genome that are inaccessible to sequence capture approaches. By using methylation-sensitive REs, repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided and lower copy regions targeted with two to three fold higher efficiency. This tremendously simplifies computationally challenging alignment problems in species with high levels of genetic diversity. The GBS procedure is demonstrated with maize (IBM) and barley (Oregon Wolfe Barley) recombinant inbred populations where roughly 200,000 and 25,000 sequence tags were mapped, respectively. An advantage in species like barley that lack a complete genome sequence is that a reference map need only be developed around the restriction sites, and this can be done in the process of sample genotyping. In such cases, the consensus of the read clusters across the sequence tagged sites becomes the reference. Alternatively, for kinship analyses in the absence of a reference genome, the sequence tags can simply be treated as dominant markers. Future application of GBS to breeding, conservation, and global species and population surveys may allow plant breeders to conduct genomic selection on a novel germplasm or species without first having to develop any prior molecular tools, or conservation biologists to determine population structure without prior knowledge of the genome or diversity in the species.},

Here we provide a historical review of both theories, present evidence that shaped their development and contrast their predictions. 2. We present the results of a meta-analysis of the utility of the RAH 25 years after it was proposed and compare it to apparency theory. We performed a meta-analysis of 50 studies that have examined plant growth, defences and herbivory in relation to resource availability across latitude and ontogeny. Specifically, we tested four predictions that follow the RAH: (i) species adapted to resource-rich environments have intrinsically faster growth rates than species adapted to resource-poor environments; (ii) fast-growing species have shorter leaf lifetimes than slow-growing species; (iii) fast-growing species have lower amounts of constitutive defences than slow-growing species; and (iv) fast-growing species support higher herbivory rates than slow-growing species. 3. Our results confirm the predictions that species adapted to resource-poor environments grow inherently more slowly, invest more in constitutive defences and support lower herbivory than species from more productive habitats. Our data also showed that variation in growth rate among species better explains the differences in herbivory than variation in apparency, suggesting that the evolution of different defensive strategies across species is resource, rather than herbivore driven. We also found that the application of this theory appears robust across latitude and ontogeny, as the magnitude of the effect sizes for most of the predictions did not vary significantly between ecosystems or across ontogenic stages. 4. We conclude that the RAH has served as a valid framework for investigating the patterns of plant defences and that its applicability is quite general.},

  abstract = {In ant societies, workers do not usually reproduce but gain indirect fitness benefits from raising related offspring produced by the queen. One of the preconditions of this worker self-restraint is sufficient fertility of the queen. The queen is, therefore, expected to signal her fertility. In Camponotus floridanus, workers can recognize the presence of a highly fertile queen via her eggs, which are marked with the queen's specific hydrocarbon profile. If information on fertility is encoded in the hydrocarbon profile of eggs, we expect workers to be able to differentiate between eggs from highly and weakly fertile queens. We found that workers discriminate between these eggs solely on the basis of their hydrocarbon profiles which differ both qualitatively and quantitatively. This pattern is further supported by the similarity of the egg profiles of workers and weakly fertile queens and the similar treatment of both kinds of eggs. Profiles of queen eggs correspond to the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of the respective queens. Changes in the cuticular profiles are associated with the size of the colony the queen originates from and her current egg-laying rate. However, partial correlation analysis indicates that only colony size predicts the cuticular profile. Colony size is a buffered indicator of queen fertility as it is a consequence of queen productivity within a certain period of time, whereas daily egg-laying rate varies due to cyclical oviposition. We conclude that surface hydrocarbons of eggs and the cuticular profiles of queens both signal queen fertility, suggesting a major role of fertility signals in the regulation of reproduction in social insects.},

Current theory considers how social learning affects the adaptiveness of a single cultural trait, yet human culture consists of the accumulation of very many traits. Here we introduce a new modeling strategy that tracks the adaptive value of many cultural traits, showing that genetic evolution favors only limited social learning owing to the accumulation of maladaptive as well as adaptive culture. We further show that culture can be adaptive, and refined social learning can evolve, if individuals can identify and discard maladaptive culture. This suggests that the evolution of such "adaptive filtering" mechanisms may have been crucial for the birth of human culture. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Genes for adaptive traits are mostly located in 'plasticity zones' in the bacterial genome, which also contain mobile elements and are highly variable across strains. By physically separating genes for information processing from genes involved in interactions with the surrounding environment, the rate of evolutionary change can be substantially enhanced for genes underlying adaptation to new growth habitats, possibly explaining the ecological success of the alpha-proteo-bacterial subdivision.},

A recent Bayesian algorithm implemented in the software structure allows the identification of such groups. However, the ability of this algorithm to detect the true number of clusters (K) in a sample of individuals when patterns of dispersal among populations are not homogeneous has not been tested. The goal of this study is to carry out such tests, using various dispersal scenarios from data generated with an individual-based model. We found that in most cases the estimated `log probability of data' does not provide a correct estimation of the number of clusters, K. However, using an ad hoc statistic {$\Delta$}K based on the rate of change in the log probability of data between successive K values, we found that structure accurately detects the uppermost hierarchical level of structure for the scenarios we tested. As might be expected, the results are sensitive to the type of genetic marker used (AFLP vs. microsatellite), the number of loci scored, the number of populations sampled, and the number of individuals typed in each sample.},

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein-protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \textbackslash AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {The Q locus played a major role in the domestication of wheat because it confers the free-threshing character and influences many other agronomically important traits. We constructed a physical contig spanning the Q locus using a Triticum monococcum BAC library. Three chromosome walking steps were performed by complete sequencing of BACs and identification of low-copy markers through similarity searches of database sequences. The BAC contig spans a physical distance of {$\sim$}300 kb corresponding to a genetic distance of 0.9 cM. The physical map of T. monococcum had perfect colinearity with the genetic map of wheat chromosome arm 5AL. Recombination data in conjunction with analysis of fast neutron deletions confirmed that the contig spanned the Q locus. The Q gene was narrowed to a 100-kb segment, which contains an APETALA2 (AP2)-like gene that cosegregates with Q. AP2 is known to play a major role in controlling floral homeotic gene expression and thus is an excellent candidate for Q.},

  abstract = {Physical mapping of wheat chromosomes has revealed small chromosome segments of high gene density and frequent recombination interspersed with relatively large regions of low gene density and infrequent recombination. We constructed a detailed genetic and physical map of one highly recombinant region on the long arm of chromosome 5B. This distally located region accounts for 4\% of the physical size of the long arm and at least 30\% of the recombination along the entire chromosome. Multiple crossovers occurred within this region, and the degree of recombination is at least 11-fold greater than the genomic average. Characteristics of the region such as gene order and frequency of recombination appear to be conserved throughout the evolution of the Triticeae. The region is more prone to chromosome breakage by gametocidal gene action than gene-poor regions, and evidence for genomic instability was implied by loss of gene collinearity for six loci among the homeologous regions. These data suggest that a unique level of chromatin organization exists within gene-rich recombination hot spots. The many agronomically important genes in this region should be accessible by positional cloning.},

  abstract = {Imitative learning, in which an individual learns to reproduce the behaviour pattern of another, has attracted considerable attention as a potentially powerful form of social learning. Despite extensive research, however, it has proved difficult to demonstrate in nonhuman animals. We investigated the ability of European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, to imitate the behaviour of a conspecific. Subjects watched a trained conspecific manipulating a plug for access to a food reward, using either a pushing or a pulling action. When later tested with the same apparatus these birds completed the task using the same action they had previously observed. In a second experiment, a separate group of starlings saw the plug move upwards or downwards automatically and a nearby conspecific obtain a food reward. When given access to the task these starlings failed to move the plug in the direction they had seen. Our experiment is an improvement on previous bidirectional control designs and provides strong evidence that starlings are capable of imitation. We advocate further use of this experimental design in attempts to demonstrate imitative learning. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Transcriptome analyses of key stages in wheat inflorescence development uncover molecular pathways and candidate genes that may be essential for final seed setting and yield improvement in wheat., Early reproductive development in cereals is crucial for final grain number per spike and hence the yield potential of the crop. To date, however, no systematic analyses of gene expression profiles during this important process have been conducted for common wheat (Triticum aestivum). Here, we studied the transcriptome profiles at four stages of early wheat reproductive development, from spikelet initiation to floral organ differentiation. K-means clustering and stage-specific transcript identification detected dynamically expressed homeologs of important transcription regulators in spikelet and floral meristems that may be involved in spikelet initiation, floret meristem specification, and floral organ patterning, as inferred from their homologs in model plants. Small RNA transcriptome sequencing discovered key microRNAs that were differentially expressed during wheat inflorescence development alongside their target genes, suggesting that miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms for floral development may be conserved in cereals and Arabidopsis. Our analysis was further substantiated by the functional characterization of the ARGONAUTE1d (AGO1d) gene, which was initially expressed in stamen primordia and later in the tapetum during anther maturation. In agreement with its stage-specific expression pattern, the loss of function of the predominantly expressed B homeolog of AGO1d in a tetraploid durum wheat mutant resulted in smaller anthers with more infertile pollens than the wild type and a reduced grain number per spike. Together, our work provides a first glimpse of the gene regulatory networks in wheat inflorescence development that may be pivotal for floral and grain development, highlighting potential targets for genetic manipulation to improve future wheat yields.},

  abstract = {Homologous recombination (HR) serves to eliminate deleterious lesions, such as double-stranded breaks and interstrand crosslinks, from chromosomes. HR is also critical for the preservation of replication forks, for telomere maintenance, and chromosome segregation in meiosis I. As such, HR is indispensable for the maintenance of genome integrity and the avoidance of cancers in humans. The HR reaction is mediated by a conserved class of enzymes termed recombinases. Two recombinases, Rad51 and Dmc1, catalyze the pairing and shuffling of homologous DNA sequences in eukaryotic cells via a filamentous intermediate on ssDNA called the presynaptic filament. The assembly of the presynaptic filament is a rate-limiting process that is enhanced by recombination mediators, such as the breast tumor suppressor BRCA2. HR accessory factors that facilitate other stages of the Rad51- and Dmc1-catalyzed homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange reaction have also been identified. Recent progress on elucidating the mechanisms of action of Rad51 and Dmc1 and their cohorts of ancillary factors is reviewed here.},

  abstract = {We report the discovery, mapping, and characterization of a meiotic drive locus (D) exhibiting nearly 100\% nonrandom transmission in hybrids between two species of yellow monkeyflowers, outcrossing Mimulus guttatus and selfing M. nasutus. Only 1\% of F2 hybrids were M. nasutus homozygotes at the marker most tightly linked to D. We used a set of reciprocal backcrosses to distinguish among male-specific, female-specific, and zygote-specific sources of transmission ratio distortion. Transmission was severely distorted only when the heterozygous F1 acted as the female parent in crosses to either parental species, ruling out pollen competition and zygote mortality as potential sources of drive. After four generations of backcrossing to M. nasutus, nearly isogenic lines were still {$>$}90\% heterozygous at markers linked to D, suggesting that heterozygosity at the drive locus alone is sufficient for nonrandom transmission. A lack of dramatic female fitness costs in these lines rules out alternatives involving ovule or seed mortality and points to a truly meiotic mechanism of drive. The strength and direction of drive in this system is consistent with population genetic theory of selfish element evolution under different mating systems. These results are the first empirical demonstration of the strong female-specific drive predicted by new models of selfish centromere turnover.},

  abstract = {Information on crop pedigrees can be used to help maximise genetic gain in crop breeding and allow efficient management of genetic resources. We present a pedigree resource of 2,657 wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes originating from 38 countries, representing more than a century of breeding and variety development. Visualisation of the pedigree enables illustration of the key developments in United Kingdom wheat breeding, highlights the wide genetic background of the UK wheat gene pool, and facilitates tracing the origin of beneficial alleles. A relatively high correlation between pedigree- and marker-based kinship coefficients was found, which validated the pedigree and enabled identification of errors in the pedigree or marker data. Using simulations with a combination of pedigree and genotype data, we found evidence for significant effects of selection by breeders. Within crosses, genotypes are often more closely related than expected by simulations to one of the parents, which indicates selection for favourable alleles during the breeding process. Selection across the pedigree was demonstrated on a subset of the pedigree in which 110 genotyped varieties released before the year 2000 were used to simulate the distribution of marker alleles of 45 genotyped varieties released after the year 2000, in the absence of selection. Allelic diversity in the 45 varieties was found to deviate significantly from the simulated distributions at a number of loci, indicating regions under selection over this period. The identification of one of these regions as coinciding with a strong yield component quantitative trait locus (QTL) highlights both the potential of the remaining loci as wheat breeding targets for further investigation, as well as the utility of this pedigree-based methodology to identify important breeding targets in other crops. Further evidence for selection was found as greater linkage disequilibrium (LD) for observed versus simulated genotypes within all chromosomes. This difference was greater at shorter genetic distances, indicating that breeder selections have conserved beneficial linkage blocks. Collectively, this work highlights the benefits of generating detailed pedigree resources for crop species. The wheat pedigree database developed here represents a valuable community resource and will be updated as new varieties are released at https://www.niab.com/pages/id/501/UK\_Wheat\_varieties\_Pedigree.},

Two species that were frequently captured in the subcan- opy, Megaerops wetmorei and Dyacoptems spadiceus, were previously thought to be rare. The abundance of Old World fruit bats in the subcanopy indicates that their roles in pollination and seed dispersal of Malaysian forest trees may be greater than previously recognized. Further research on foraging ranges, food selection and roosting habits is required to determine the overall importance of fruit bats in forest regeneration through seed dispersal, and the adequacy of existing reserves for their conservation.},

However, our experiments suggest that the ants use ambient light levels within the nest cavity to assess the abundance of nest entrances rather than counting per se. Intriguingly, Weber's Law cannot explain the ants' inaccuracy. The ants also use a second metric, independent of light, to assess and discriminate against wide entrances. Thus, these ants use at least two metrics to evaluate one nest trait: the configuration of the portals to their potential homes.},

However, how leaf development was altered during evolution remains unknown. Here we show that the pitcher leaves of Sarracenia purpurea develop through cell division patterns of adaxial tissues that are distinct from those in bifacial and peltate leaves, subsequent to standard expression of adaxial and abaxial marker genes. Differences in the orientation of cell divisions in the adaxial domain cause bifacial growth in the distal region and adaxial ridge protrusion in the middle region. These different growth patterns establish pitcher morphology. A computer simulation suggests that the cell division plane is critical for the pitcher morphogenesis. Our results imply that tissue-specific changes in the orientation of cell division underlie the development of a morphologically complex leaf.},

Monogenic segregations of seven isozyme markers were analyzed in F2and reciprocal backcross progenies of an interspecific hybrid between Lycopersicon esculentum and L. pennellii (LA 716). In the F2 population, four markers, which map to three different chromosomes, deviated significantly from the expected Mendelian ratios and in all cases an excess of the L. pennellii alleles was observed. In the backcrosses all the genes segregated normally. These results and the lack of effect of different gametophytic selection conditions on the deviations indicated that the elimination of L. esculentum alleles in the F2did not occur at prezygotic stages. Three of the isozymes were assayed in mature F2seed and revealed similar deviations to those observed in F2 plants. These findings, as well as the lower numbers of seed per fruit observed in the F2than in the backcross (where the hybrid functioned as female parent), indicate that differential zygotic abortion is the main cause of the unequal segregations. In addition, analysis of two linkage groups in the reciprocal backcrosses revealed higher recombination frequencies on the female side.},

And due to limited number of selectable marker genes, identification or selection of those cells that have integrated DNA into appropriate plant genome and to regenerate fully developed plants from the transformed cells, becomes even more difficult. Some of the widely used marker genes belong to the categories of herbicide or antibiotic resistance genes and flourescent protein genes. As they become an integral part of plant genome along with promoters prokaryotic or eukaryotic origin, there are certain health and environmental concerns about the use of these reporter genes. These marker genes are also inefficient with respect to time and space. In this study we have found a novel visible selection agent AtMYB12, to screen transgenic wheat, with in days after transformation. Transformed coleoptiles as well as cells regenerating from transformed cultured scutella, phenotypically exhibit purple pigmentation, making selection possible in limited and reasonable cost, time and space.},

  abstract = {Polyploidy is a pivotal process in plant evolution as it increase gene redundancy and morphological intricacy but due to the complexity of polysomic inheritance we have only few genetic maps of autopolyploid organisms. A robust mapping framework is particularly important in polyploid crop species, rose included (2n = 4x = 28), where the objective is to study multiallelic interactions that control traits of value for plant breeding. From a cross between the garden, peach red and fragrant cultivar Fragrant Cloud (FC) and a cut-rose yellow cultivar Golden Gate (GG), we generated an autotetraploid GGFC mapping population consisting of 132 individuals. For the map we used 128 sequence-based markers, 141 AFLP, 86 SSR and three morphological markers. Seven linkage groups were resolved for FC (Total 632 cM) and GG (616 cM) which were validated by markers that segregated in both parents as well as the diploid integrated consensus map. The release of the Fragaria vesca genome, which also belongs to the Rosoideae, allowed us to place 70 rose sequenced markers on the seven strawberry pseudo-chromosomes. Synteny between Rosa and Fragaria was high with an estimated four major translocations and six inversions required to place the 17 non-collinear markers in the same order. Based on a verified linear order of the rose markers, we could further partition each of the parents into its four homologous groups, thus providing an essential framework to aid the sequencing of an autotetraploid genome.},

  abstract = {BackgroundSequence exchange between homologous chromosomes through crossing over and gene conversion is highly conserved among eukaryotes, contributing to genome stability and genetic diversity. A lack of recombination limits breeding efforts in crops; therefore, increasing recombination rates can reduce linkage drag and generate new genetic combinations.ResultsWe use computational analysis of 13 recombinant inbred mapping populations to assess crossover and gene conversion frequency in the hexaploid genome of wheat (Triticum aestivum). We observe that high-frequency crossover sites are shared between populations and that closely related parents lead to populations with more similar crossover patterns. We demonstrate that gene conversion is more prevalent and covers more of the genome in wheat than in other plants, making it a critical process in the generation of new haplotypes, particularly in centromeric regions where crossovers are rare. We identify quantitative trait loci for altered gene conversion and crossover frequency and confirm functionality for a novel RecQ helicase gene that belongs to an ancient clade that is missing in some plant lineages including Arabidopsis.ConclusionsThis is the first gene to be demonstrated to be involved in gene conversion in wheat. Harnessing the RecQ helicase has the potential to break linkage drag utilizing widespread gene conversions.},

To understand this process, we survey genotype, repeat content, and DNA methylation across a bread wheat landrace collection representing global genetic diversity. We identify independent variation in methylation, genotype, and transposon copy number. We show that these, so far unexploited, sources of variation have had a significant impact on the wheat genome and that ancestral methylation states become preferentially ``hard coded'' as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) via 5-methylcytosine deamination. These mechanisms also drive local adaption, impacting important traits such as heading date and salt tolerance. Methylation and transposon diversity could therefore be used alongside SNP-based markers for breeding.},

We have constructed the first eight?parent MAGIC genetic map for wheat, comprising 18~601 SNP markers. We validated the accuracy of our map against the wheat genome sequence and found an improvement in accuracy compared to published genetic maps. Our map shows a notable increase in precision resulting from the three generations of intercrossing required to create the population. This is most pronounced in the pericentromeric regions of the chromosomes. Sixteen percent of mapped markers exhibited segregation distortion (SD) with many occurring in long ({$>$}20~cM) blocks. Some of the longest and most distorted blocks were collinear with noncentromeric high?marker?density regions of the genome, suggesting they were candidates for introgression fragments introduced into the bread wheat gene pool from other grass species. We investigated two of these linkage blocks in detail and found strong evidence that one on chromosome 4AL, showing SD against the founder Robigus, is an interspecific introgression fragment.

Their effects on attachment and locomotion of the fly Calliphora vomitoria were studied. The waxy surface of N. ventrata is comprised of a heterogeneous layer from which only platelet-shaped crystalloids could be detached by brushing. In the two bromeliads, the crystalloids are thread-shaped and form a homogenous dense network, which was entirely removable from the epidermis. Experimental data showed that none of the flies was able to walk across any of the waxy surfaces and only a few were able to take off from those surfaces. Both the absence of sites for claw anchorage, especially in N. ventrata, and the wax itself were shown to contribute to the trapping ability of the plants. Only half of the flies quickly recovered their locomotion ability on a glass surface after 20 min of being tested on waxy plant surfaces. SEM observations revealed that the wax of C. berteroniana formed a powder of broken crystals on the tenent setae of the flies' pulvilli. In contrast, the waxes of B. reducta and N. ventrata appeared to have lost their crystal structure in contact with the tenent setae and formed an amorphous substance that adhered setae together. We hypothesize that wax interacts with adhesive fluids secreted by the fly pad and thereby prevents the tenent setae from functioning effectively. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Sexual selection arising through female mate choice typically favours males with larger, brighter and louder signals. A critical challenge in sexual selection research is to determine the degree to which this pattern results from direct mate choice, where females select individual males based on variation in signalling traits, or indirect mate choice, where male competition governs access to reproductively active females. We investigated female mate choice in a lekking Lake Malawi cichlid fish, Hemitilapia oxyrhynchus, in which males build and aggressively defend sand 'bowers'. Similar to previous studies, we found that male reproductive success was positively associated with bower height and centrality on the lek. However, this pattern resulted from males holding these territories encountering more females, and thus their greater success was due to indirect mate choice. Following initial male courtship, an increase in the relative mating success of some males was observed, but this relative increase was unrelated to bower size or position. Crucially, experimentally manipulating bowers to resemble those of a co-occurring species had no appreciable effect on direct choice by females or male spawning success. Together, these results suggest indirect mate choice is the dominant force determining male-mating success in this species, and that bowers are not signals used in direct mate choice by females. We propose that, in this species, bowers have a primary function in intraspecific male competition, with the most competitive males maintaining larger and more central bowers that are favoured by sexual selection due to higher female encounter rates.},

To investigate the process of degeneration of the olfactory repertoire in primates, we estimated the proportion of OR pseudogenes in 19 primate species by surveying randomly chosen subsets of 100 OR genes from each species. We find that apes, Old World monkeys and one New World monkey, the howler monkey, have a significantly higher proportion of OR pseudogenes than do other New World monkeys or the lemur (a prosimian). Strikingly, the howler monkey is also the only New World monkey to possess full trichromatic vision, along with Old World monkeys and apes.

A consensus physical map was compared with the 1D genetic map of Triticum tauschii (68 markers) and a Triticeae group 1 consensus map (288 markers) to generate a cytogenetic ladder map (CLM). Most group 1 markers (86\%) were present in five clusters that encompassed only 10\% of the group 1 chromosome. This distribution may reflect that of genes because more than half of the probes were cDNA clones and 30\% were PstI genomic. All 14 agronomically important genes in group 1 chromosomes were present in these clusters. Most recombination occurred in gene-cluster regions. Markers fell at an average distance of 244 kb in these regions. The CLM involving the Triticeae consensus genetic map revealed that the above distribution of genes and recombination is the same in other Triticeae species. Because of a significant number of common markers, our CLM can be used for comparative mapping and to estimate physical distances among markers in many Poaceae species including rice and maize.},

The region number is separated from the band number by a decimal point.

One, the warm cell, responds to rapid warming with a sudden increase in the rate of discharge. The other, a cold cell, responds to rapid cooling with a sudden increase in the discharge rate. When temperature changes are provided by oscillating changes in the convective heat contained in the stimulating air stream, the oscillating discharge rates of both cell types are in advance of the oscillations in temperature and slightly behind the oscillations in the rate of temperature change. Analysis of these phase relationships shows that both cell types respond not only to the actual temperature at particular instance in time (instantaneous temperature) but also to the rate with which temperature changes. Individual responses are therefore ambiguous and signal tendencies rather than precise instantaneous values. When the temperature oscillations are delivered by changes in radiation power, however, the oscillating discharge rates of the warm and cold cells are in step with the oscillations in temperature. Here, individual responses signal instantaneous values of temperature rather than tendencies. The power of radiant heat required to modulate the discharge rates is relatively high, suggesting that infrared radiation is not a significant cue in distant host location.},

Here, we report a detailed, genome-wide characterization of the rate and localization of COs in Arabidopsis thaliana, in male and female meiosis. We observed dramatic differences between male and female meiosis which included: (i) genetic map length; 575 cM versus 332 cM respectively; (ii) CO distribution patterns: male CO rates were very high at both ends of each chromosome, whereas female CO rates were very low; (iii) correlations between CO rates and various chromosome features: female CO rates correlated strongly and negatively with GC content and gene density but positively with transposable elements (TEs) density, whereas male CO rates correlated positively with the CpG ratio. However, except for CpG, the correlations could be explained by the unequal repartition of these sequences along the Arabidopsis chromosome. For both male and female meiosis, the number of COs per chromosome correlates with chromosome size expressed either in base pairs or as synaptonemal complex length. Finally, we show that interference modulates the CO distribution both in male and female meiosis.},

  abstract = {``Soft'' and ``hard'' are the two main market classes of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and are distinguished by expression of the Hardness gene. Friabilin, a marker protein for grain softness (Ha), consists of two proteins, puroindoline a and b (pinA and pinB, respectively). We previously demonstrated that a glycine to serine mutation in pinB is linked inseparably to grain hardness. Here, we report that the pinB serine mutation is present in 9 of 13 additional randomly selected hard wheats and in none of 10 soft wheats. The four exceptional hard wheats not containing the serine mutation in pinB express no pinA, the remaining component of the marker protein friabilin. The absence of pinA protein was linked inseparably to grain hardness among 44 near-isogenic lines created between the soft variety Heron and the hard variety Falcon. Both pinA and pinB apparently are required for the expression of grain softness. The absence of pinA protein and transcript and a glycine-to-serine mutation in pinB are two highly conserved mutations associated with grain hardness, and these friabilin genes are the suggested tightly linked components of the Hardness gene. A previously described grain hardness related gene termed ``GSP-1'' (grain softness protein) is not controlled by chromosome 5D and is apparently not involved in grain hardness. The association of grain hardness with mutations in both pinA or pinB indicates that these two proteins alone may function together to effect grain softness. Elucidation of the molecular basis for grain hardness opens the way to understanding and eventually manipulating this wheat endosperm property.},

  abstract = {Inferring the role of interactions in territorial animals relies upon accurate recordings of the behaviour of neighbouring individuals. Such accurate recordings are rarely available from field studies. As a result, quantification of the interaction mechanisms has often relied upon theoretical approaches, which hitherto have been limited to comparisons of macroscopic population-level predictions from un-tested interaction models. Here we present a quantitative framework that possesses a microscopic testable hypothesis on the mechanism of conspecific avoidance mediated by olfactory signals in the form of scent marks. We find that the key parameters controlling territoriality are two: the average territory size, i.e. the inverse of the population density, and the time span during which animal scent marks remain active. Since permanent monitoring of a territorial border is not possible, scent marks need to function in the temporary absence of the resident. As chemical signals carried by the scent only last a finite amount of time, each animal needs to revisit territorial boundaries frequently and refresh its own scent marks in order to deter possible intruders. The size of the territory an animal can maintain is thus proportional to the time necessary for an animal to move between its own territorial boundaries. By using an agent-based model to take into account the possible spatio-temporal movement trajectories of individual animals, we show that the emerging territories are the result of a form of collective animal movement where, different to shoaling, flocking or herding, interactions are highly heterogeneous in space and time. The applicability of our hypothesis has been tested with a prototypical territorial animal, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes).},

However, this result has been questioned, and a robust phylogeny of wheat relatives is still lacking. Using transcriptome data from all diploid species and a new methodological approach, our comprehensive phylogenomic analysis revealed that more than half of the species descend from an ancient hybridization event but with a more complex scenario involving a different parent than previously thought\textemdash Aegilops mutica, an overlooked wild species\textemdash instead of the B genome. We also detected other extensive gene flow events that could explain long-standing controversies in the classification of wheat relatives.

  abstract = {Conserving pollinator services for crops If pollination fails, ecosystems are eroded and we will lose reliable sources of many critical foodstuffs. Focusing on the pollination services provided by bees, Goulson et al. review the stresses bees are experiencing from climate change, infectious diseases, and insecticides. We can mitigate some of the stress on bees by improving floral resources and adopting quarantine measures, and by surveillance of bee populations. Crucially, we need to resolve the controversy surrounding prophylactic use of pesticides. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1255957 Structured Abstract BACKGROUND The species richness of wild bees and other pollinators has declined over the past 50 years, with some species undergoing major declines and a few going extinct. Evidence of the causes of these losses is patchy and incomplete, owing to inadequate monitoring systems. Managed honey bee stocks have also declined in North America and many European countries, although they have increased substantially in China. During this same period, the demand for insect pollination of crops has approximately tripled, and the importance of wild pollinators in providing such services has become increasingly apparent, leading to concern that we may be nearing a ``pollination crisis'' in which crop yields begin to fall. This has stimulated much-needed research into the causes of bee declines. Habitat loss, which has reduced the abundance and diversity of floral resources and nesting opportunities, has undoubtedly been a major long-term driver through the 20th century and still continues today. In addition, both wild and managed bees have been exposed to a succession of emerging parasites and pathogens that have been accidentally moved around the world by human action. The intensification of agriculture and increasing reliance on pesticides means that pollinators are also chronically exposed to cocktails of agrochemicals. Predicted changes in global climate are likely to further exacerbate such problems in the future. ADVANCES It has lately become clear that stressors do not act in isolation and that their interactions may be difficult to predict; for example, some pesticides act synergistically rather than additively. Both pesticide exposure and food stress can impair immune responses, rendering bees more susceptible to parasites. It seems certain that chronic exposure to multiple interacting stressors is driving honey bee colony losses and declines of wild pollinators, but the precise combination apparently differs from place to place. Although the causes of pollinator decline may be complex and subject to disagreement, solutions need not be; taking steps to reduce or remove any of these stresses is likely to benefit pollinator health. Several techniques are available that have been demonstrated to effectively increase floral availability in farmland. Similarly, encouraging gardeners to grow appropriate bee-friendly flowers and to improve management of amenity grasslands can also reduce dietary stress. Retaining or restoring areas of seminatural habitat within farmland will improve nest site availability. A return to the principles of integrated pest management and avoidance of prophylactic use of agrochemicals could greatly decrease exposure of bees to pesticides. OUTLOOK Interactions among agrochemicals and stressors are not addressed by current regulatory procedures, which typically expose well-fed, parasite-free bees to a single pesticide for a short period of time.

  abstract = {Conserving pollinator services for crops If pollination fails, ecosystems are eroded and we will lose reliable sources of many critical foodstuffs. Focusing on the pollination services provided by bees, Goulson et al. review the stresses bees are experiencing from climate change, infectious diseases, and insecticides. We can mitigate some of the stress on bees by improving floral resources and adopting quarantine measures, and by surveillance of bee populations. Crucially, we need to resolve the controversy surrounding prophylactic use of pesticides. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1255957 Structured Abstract BACKGROUND The species richness of wild bees and other pollinators has declined over the past 50 years, with some species undergoing major declines and a few going extinct. Evidence of the causes of these losses is patchy and incomplete, owing to inadequate monitoring systems. Managed honey bee stocks have also declined in North America and many European countries, although they have increased substantially in China. During this same period, the demand for insect pollination of crops has approximately tripled, and the importance of wild pollinators in providing such services has become increasingly apparent, leading to concern that we may be nearing a ``pollination crisis'' in which crop yields begin to fall. This has stimulated much-needed research into the causes of bee declines. Habitat loss, which has reduced the abundance and diversity of floral resources and nesting opportunities, has undoubtedly been a major long-term driver through the 20th century and still continues today. In addition, both wild and managed bees have been exposed to a succession of emerging parasites and pathogens that have been accidentally moved around the world by human action. The intensification of agriculture and increasing reliance on pesticides means that pollinators are also chronically exposed to cocktails of agrochemicals. Predicted changes in global climate are likely to further exacerbate such problems in the future. ADVANCES It has lately become clear that stressors do not act in isolation and that their interactions may be difficult to predict; for example, some pesticides act synergistically rather than additively. Both pesticide exposure and food stress can impair immune responses, rendering bees more susceptible to parasites. It seems certain that chronic exposure to multiple interacting stressors is driving honey bee colony losses and declines of wild pollinators, but the precise combination apparently differs from place to place. Although the causes of pollinator decline may be complex and subject to disagreement, solutions need not be; taking steps to reduce or remove any of these stresses is likely to benefit pollinator health. Several techniques are available that have been demonstrated to effectively increase floral availability in farmland. Similarly, encouraging gardeners to grow appropriate bee-friendly flowers and to improve management of amenity grasslands can also reduce dietary stress. Retaining or restoring areas of seminatural habitat within farmland will improve nest site availability. A return to the principles of integrated pest management and avoidance of prophylactic use of agrochemicals could greatly decrease exposure of bees to pesticides. OUTLOOK Interactions among agrochemicals and stressors are not addressed by current regulatory procedures, which typically expose well-fed, parasite-free bees to a single pesticide for a short period of time. Devising approaches to study these interactions and incorporating them into the regulatory process poses a major challenge. In the meantime, providing support and advice for farmers in more sustainable farming methods with reduced pesticide use is likely to have broad benefits for farmland biodiversity. Enforcing effective quarantine measures on bee movements to prevent further spread of bee parasites is also vital. Finally, effective monitoring of wild pollinator populations is urgently needed to inform management strategies. Without this, we have no early warning system to tell us how close we may be to a pollination crisis. With a growing human population and rapid growth in global demand for pollination services, we cannot afford to see crop yields begin to fall, and we would be well advised to take preemptive action to ensure that we have adequate pollination services into the future. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/347/6229/1255957/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Multiple interacting stressors drive bee declines.

  abstract = {Vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) are obligate blood feeders that have evolved specialized systems to suit their unique sanguinary lifestyle 1\textendash 3. Chief among such adaptations is the ability to detect infrared radiation as a means of locating hot spots on warm-blooded prey. Among vertebrates, only vampire bats, boas, pythons, and pit vipers are capable of detecting infrared radiation 1,4. In each case, infrared heat is detected by trigeminal nerve fibers that innervate specialized pit organs on the animal's face 5\textendash 10. Thus, vampire bats and snakes have taken thermosensation to the extreme by developing specialized systems for detecting infrared radiation. As such, these creatures provide a window into the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying evolutionary tuning of thermoreceptors in a species or cell type specific manner. Previously, we have shown that snakes co-opt a non-heat sensitive channel (vertebrate TRPA1) to produce an infrared detector 6. Here we show that vampire bats tune an already heat sensitive channel (TRPV1) by lowering its thermal activation threshold to {$\sim$}30\textdegree C. This is achieved through alternative splicing of TRPV1 transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Remarkably, these splicing events occur exclusively in trigeminal ganglia (TG), and not dorsal root ganglia (DRG), thereby maintaining a role for TRPV1 as a detector of noxious heat in somatic afferents. This reflects a unique organization of the bat TRPV1 gene that we show to be characteristic of Laurasiatheria mammals (cows, dogs, and moles), supporting a close phylogenetic relationship with bats. These findings reveal a unique molecular mechanism for physiological tuning of thermosensory nerve fibers.},

Infrared signals are initially received by the pit organ, a highly specialized facial structure that is innervated by nerve fibres of the somatosensory system. How this organ detects and transduces infrared signals into nerve impulses is not known. Here we use an unbiased transcriptional profiling approach to identify TRPA1 channels as infrared receptors on sensory nerve fibres that innervate the pit organ. TRPA1 orthologues from pit-bearing snakes (vipers, pythons and boas) are the most heat-sensitive vertebrate ion channels thus far identified, consistent with their role as primary transducers of infrared stimuli. Thus, snakes detect infrared signals through a mechanism involving radiant heating of the pit organ, rather than photochemical transduction. These findings illustrate the broad evolutionary tuning of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels as thermosensors in the vertebrate nervous system.},

  abstract = {Coinfection of a host by multiple parasite species has important epidemiological and clinical implications. However, the direction and magnitude of effects vary considerably among systems, and, until now, there has been no general framework within which to explain this variation. Community ecology has great potential for application to such problems in biomedicine. Here, metaanalysis of data from 54 experiments on laboratory mice reveals that basic ecological rules govern the outcome of coinfection across a broad spectrum of parasite taxa. Specifically, resource-based ("bottom-up") and predator-based ("top-down") control mechanisms combined to determine microparasite population size in helminth-coinfected hosts. Coinfection imposed bottom-up control (resulting in decreased microparasite density) when a helminth that causes anemia was paired with a microparasite species that requires host red blood cells. At the same time, coinfection impaired top-down control of microparasites by the immune system: the greater the helminth-induced suppression of the inflammatory cytokine interferon (IFN)-gamma, the greater the increase in microparasite density. These results suggest that microparasite population growth will be most explosive when underlying helminths do not impose resource limitations but do strongly modulate IFN-gamma responses. Surprisingly simple rules and an ecological framework within which to analyze biomedical data thus emerge from analysis of this dataset. Through such an interdisciplinary lens, predicting the outcome of coinfection may become tractable.},

Alternatively, immunomodulatory effects of helminths might affect the likelihood of malarial immunopathology. Using rodent models of lymphatic filariasis (Litomosoides sigmodontis) and noncerebral malaria (clone AS Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi), we quantified disease severity, parasitemia, and polyclonal splenic immune responses in BALB/c mice. We found that coinfected mice, particularly those that did not have microfilaremia (Mf(-)), had more severe anemia and loss of body mass than did mice with malaria alone. Even when controlling for parasitemia, malaria was most severe in Mf(-) coinfected mice, and this was associated with increased interferon- gamma responsiveness. Thus, in Mf(-) mice, filariasis upset a delicate immunological balance in malaria infection and exacerbated malaria-induced immunopathology.},

  abstract = {Songs of Darwin's finches were studied on the Galapagos Island of Daphne Major from 1976 to 1995. A single, structurally simple, and unvarying song is sung throughout life by each male of the two common species, Geospiza fortis (medium ground finch) and G. scandens (cactus finch). Songs of the two species differ strongly in quantitative features, and individual variation among males is much broader in G. fortis than in G. scandens. Although there are exceptions, songs of sons strongly resemble the songs of their fathers. They also resemble the songs of their paternal grandfathers, but not their maternal grandfathers, indicating that they are culturally inherited and not genetically inherited. Female G. fortis display a tendency to avoid mating with males that sing the same type of song as their father. They also avoid mating with males that sing heterospecific song, with very rare exceptions. Thus song, an evolving, culturally inherited trait, is an important factor in species recognition and mate choice. It constrains the mating of females to conspecifics, even when there is no genetic penalty to interbreeding, and thus may play a crucial role in species formation by promoting genetic isolation on secondary contact. The barrier is leaky in that occasional errors in song transmission result in misimprinting, which leads to a low incidence of hybridization and introgression. Introgression slows the rate of postzygotic isolation, but can produce individuals in novel genetic and morphological space that can provide the starting point of a new evolutionary trajectory.},

The effects of selection were transmitted to the next generation as a result of high trait heritabilities. Hybridization between this species and two others resulted in gene exchange, but only after the El Nino when hybrid fitness was much enhanced under the altered feeding conditions.

Testing the predictions requires measurement of the offspring of the selected group, a requirement that is difficult to meet. We present the results of a study of Darwin's finches on the Galapagos island of Daphne Major where this requirement is met. The study demonstrates microevolutionary consequences of natural selection. The population of medium ground finches, Geospiza fortis, experienced size-selective mortality during a drought in 1976-1977; large birds with deep beaks survived better than small birds. During another drought, 1984-1986, the population experienced selection in the opposite direction on beak traits. Changes in food supply were the apparent causes of selection on beak traits in both episodes. As expected from the high heritabilities of all measured traits, the effects of selection were transmitted to the next generation. Evolutionary responses to both episodes of selection were quantitatively well predicted in general. This allows us to conclude that, to a first approximation, targets of selection were identified correctly, and genetic parameters were correctly estimated. Nevertheless, not all responses of individual traits were equally well predicted. A search for possible reasons for the largest discrepancies revealed evidence of bias caused by environmental effects on growth and adult size of some traits, as well as possible selection on the offspring generation before their measurement. These findings illustrate an important assumption in the study of microevolution: that the environments experienced during growth to maturity by the parental and offspring generations are the same, for otherwise a measured difference between generations may have a partly environmental cause, thereby giving a misleading estimate of the evolutionary response to selection. Simple extrapolations from observed selection to long-term evolution may underestimate the total force of selection involved if it oscillates in direction or acts on the environmental variance.},

Greber et al. looked at titanium isotopes in shales, which form from eroded continental crustal sediments, to estimate the composition 3.5 billion years ago, closer to the origins of Earth. They found a silica-rich composition, which indicates that plate tectonics was happening deep in our distant past. Other changes in crustal composition might be linked to changing ocean chemistry and major events such as the oxygenation of our atmosphere. Science, this issue p. 1271 Earth exhibits a dichotomy in elevation and chemical composition between the continents and ocean floor. Reconstructing when this dichotomy arose is important for understanding when plate tectonics started and how the supply of nutrients to the oceans changed through time. We measured the titanium isotopic composition of shales to constrain the chemical composition of the continental crust exposed to weathering and found that shales of all ages have a uniform isotopic composition. This can only be explained if the emerged crust was predominantly felsic (silica-rich) since 3.5 billion years ago, requiring an early initiation of plate tectonics. We also observed a change in the abundance of biologically important nutrients phosphorus and nickel across the Archean-Proterozoic boundary, which might have helped trigger the rise in atmospheric oxygen.

  abstract = {Pseudomonas syringae pv. aesculi is a pathogenic bacterium causing bleeding canker disease of horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum). This is a serious disease which has been affecting horse chestnut in several European countries over the last five years; however, very little is known about the biology of the causal agent. One of the obstacles to studying this pathogen is the lengthy procedure associated with confirming its presence on the host. In this study, P. syringae pv. aesculi was isolated from lesions on different parts of horse chestnut and its pathogenicity confirmed on horse chestnut saplings using two inoculation techniques. Real-time PCR primers were developed based on gyrase B gene sequence data for the specific detection of P. syringae pv. aesculi. Primer specificity was tested on isolates of the target pathogen as well as on a broad range of related non-target bacteria and other bacterial spp. which inhabit horse chestnut. The real-time primers reliably amplified P. syringae pv. aesculi down to 1 pg of extracted DNA, with and without the presence of host DNA, and also amplified unextracted DNA in whole cells of the bacterium down to at least 160 colony forming units. Detection and quantification of the target pathogen in phloem and xylem of both naturally infected and inoculated horse chestnut tissues was also demonstrated. This quantitative real-time PCR assay provides the facility to study several important aspects of the biology of P. syringae pv. aesculi on horse chestnut including its potential for dissemination in different substrates.},

  abstract = {It has been known since the last century that the bill of the platypus contains densely packed arrays of specialized receptor organs and their afferent nerves. Until recently these were thought to be largely mechanoreceptive in function. However Scheich et al. provide both behavioural and electrophysiological evidence that there are electroreceptors in the bill of the platypus. These authors were able to record evoked potentials from the somatosensory cortex of the brain in response to weak voltage pulses applied across the bill. Behavioural observations showed that a platypus could detect weak electric dipoles and it was suggested the animal was able to locate moving prey by the electrical activity associated with muscle contractions. From these observations, and in view of the fact that it was known that the bill contained gland receptors which in several respects resembled the ampullary electroreceptors in fresh-water fish, Scheich et al. concluded that the receptor array of the platypus bill included electroreceptors. In this report we present direct electrophysiological evidence for the existence of such receptors.},

  abstract = {Key message Genome-wide introgressions of Thinopyrum bessarabicum into wheat resulted in 12 recombinant lines. Cytological and molecular techniques allowed mapping of 1150 SNP markers across all seven chromosomes of the J genome. Abstract Thinopyrum bessarabicum (2n~=~2x~=~14, JJ) is an important source for new genetic variation for wheat improvement due to its salinity tolerance and disease resistance. Its practical utilisation in wheat improvement can be facilitated through development of genome-wide introgressions leading to a variety of different wheat\textendash Th . bessarabicum translocation lines. In this study, we report the generation of 12 such wheat\textendash Th . bessarabicum recombinant lines, through two different crossing strategies, which were characterized using sequential single colour and multi-colour genomic in situ hybridization (sc-GISH and mc-GISH), multi-colour fluorescent in situ hybridization (mc-FISH) and single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) DNA markers. We also detected 13 lines containing different Th. bessarabicum chromosome aberrations through sc-GISH. Through a combination of molecular and cytological analysis of all the 25 lines containing Th. bessarabicum recombinants and chromosome aberrations we were able to physically map~1150 SNP markers onto seven Th. bessarabicum J chromosomes which were divided into 36 segmental blocks. Comparative analysis of the physical map of Th. bessarabicum and the wheat genome showed that synteny between the two species is highly conserved at the macro-level and confirmed that Th. bessarabicum contains the 4/5 translocation also present in the A genome of wheat. These wheat\textendash Th . bessarabicum recombinant lines and SNP markers provide a useful genetic resource for wheat improvement with the latter having a wider impact as a tool for detection of introgressions from other Thinopyrum species containing the J or a closely-related genome such as Thinopyrum intermedium (JrJrJvsJvsStSt) and Thinopyrum elongatum (EeEe), respectively.

  abstract = {Tritcum urartu (2n = 2x = 14, AuAu), the A genome donor of wheat, is an important source for new genetic variation for wheat improvement due to its high photosynthetic rate and disease resistance. By facilitating the generation of genome-wide introgressions leading to a variety of different wheat\textendash T. urartu translocation lines, T. urartu can be practically utilised in wheat improvement. Previous studies that have generated such introgression lines have been unable to successfully use cytological methods to detect the presence of T. urartu in these lines. Many have, thus, used a variety of molecular markers with limited success due to the low-density coverage of these markers and time-consuming nature of the techniques rendering them unsuitable for large-scale breeding programs. In this study, we report the generation of a resource of single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers, present on a high-throughput SNP genotyping array, that can detect the presence of T. urartu in a hexaploid wheat background making it a potentially valuable tool in wheat pre-breeding programs. A whole genome introgression approach has resulted in the transfer of different chromosome segments from T. urartu into wheat which have then been detected and characterised using these SNP markers. The molecular analysis of these wheat-T. urartu recombinant lines has resulted in the generation of a genetic map of T. urartu containing 368 SNP markers, spread across all seven chromosomes of T. urartu. Comparative analysis of the genetic map of T. urartu and the physical map of the hexaploid wheat genome showed that synteny between the two species is highly conserved at the macro-level and confirmed the presence of the 4/5 translocation in T. urartu also present in the A genome of wheat. A panel of 17 wheat-T. urartu recombinant lines, which consisted of introgressed segments that covered the whole genome of T. urartu, were also selected for self-fertilisation to provide a germplasm resource for future trait analysis. This valuable resource of high-density molecular markers specifically designed for detecting wild relative chromosomes and a panel of stable interspecific introgression lines will greatly enhance the efficiency of wheat improvement through wild relative introgressions.},

  abstract = {The foundation of western civilization owes much to the high fertility of bread wheat, which results from the stability of its polyploid genome. Despite possessing multiple sets of related chromosomes, hexaploid (bread) and tetraploid (pasta) wheat both behave as diploids at meiosis. Correct pairing of homologous chromosomes is controlled by the Ph1 locus1. In wheat hybrids, Ph1 prevents pairing between related chromosomes2. Lack of Ph1 activity in diploid relatives of wheat suggests that Ph1 arose on polyploidization3. Absence of phenotypic variation, apart from dosage effects, and the failure of ethylmethane sulphonate treatment to yield mutants, indicates that Ph1 has a complex structure4,5. Here we have localized Ph1 to a 2.5-megabase interstitial region of wheat chromosome 5B containing a structure consisting of a segment of subtelomeric heterochromatin that inserted into a cluster of cdc2-related genes after polyploidization. The correlation of the presence of this structure with Ph1 activity in related species, and the involvement of heterochromatin with Ph1 (ref. 6) and cdc2 genes with meiosis, makes the structure a good candidate for the Ph1 locus.},

  abstract = {The spot blotch disease of wheat is caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana, which is an anamorph (teleomorph Cochliobolus sativus). The disease mainly occurs in warm, humid wheat-growing regions, and the Eastern Gangetic Plains (EGP) of South Asia is a hotspot. Significant progress has been made in recent years in characterizing the host\textendash pathogen interaction. The study of the pathogen's life cycle and diversity have been an active area of research. A number of resistance sources have also been identified, characterized and used for breeding. Although immunity has not been observed in any genotype, cultivars displaying a relatively high level of resistance have been developed and made available to farmers. Further progress will require regular use of marker-assisted breeding, genomic selection, gene editing and transgenic interventions. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge about genetic and breeding efforts on the wheat\textendash B.~sorokiniana pathosystem and discusses ways in which emerging tools can be used for future research to understand the mechanism involved in infection and for developing cultivars exhibiting a high level of resistance.},

  abstract = {New sequencing and genotyping technologies have enabled researchers to generate high density SNP genotype data for mapping populations. In polyploid species, SNP data usually contain a new type of information, the allele dosage, which is not used by current methodologies for linkage analysis and QTL mapping. Here we extend existing methodology to use dosage data on SNPs in an autotetraploid mapping population. The SNP dosages are inferred from allele intensity ratios using normal mixture models. The steps of the linkage analysis (testing for distorted segregation, clustering SNPs, calculation of recombination fractions and LOD scores, ordering of SNPs and inference of parental phase) are extended to use the dosage information. For QTL analysis, the probability of each possible offspring genotype is inferred at a grid of locations along the chromosome from the ordered parental genotypes and phases and the offspring dosages. A normal mixture model is then used to relate trait values to the offspring genotypes and to identify the most likely locations for QTLs. These methods are applied to analyse a tetraploid potato mapping population of parents and 190 offspring, genotyped using an Infinium 8300 Potato SNP Array. Linkage maps for each of the 12 chromosomes are constructed. The allele intensity ratios are mapped as quantitative traits to check that their position and phase agrees with that of the corresponding SNP. This analysis confirms most SNP positions, and eliminates some problem SNPs to give high-density maps for each chromosome, with between 74 and 152 SNPs mapped and between 100 and 300 further SNPs allocated to approximate bins. Low numbers of double reduction products were detected. Overall 3839 of the 5378 polymorphic SNPs can be assigned putative genetic locations. This methodology can be applied to construct high-density linkage maps in any autotetraploid species, and could also be extended to higher autopolyploids.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an antithesis to the view that gregarious behaviour is evolved through benefits to the population or species. Following Galton (1871) and Williams (1964) gregarious behaviour is considered as a form of cover-seeking in which each animal tries to reduce its chance of being caught by a predator. It is easy to see how pruning of marginal individuals can maintain centripetal instincts in already gregarious species; some evidence that marginal pruning actually occurs is summarized. Besides this, simply defined models are used to show that even in non-gregarious species selection is likely to favour individuals who stay close to others. Although not universal or unipotent, cover-seeking is a widespread and important element in animal aggregation, as the literature shows. Neglect of the idea has probably followed from a general disbelief that evolution can be dysgenic for a species. Nevertheless, selection theory provides no support for such disbelief in the case of species with outbreeding or unsubdivided populations. The model for two dimensions involves a complex problem in geometrical probability which has relevance also in metallurgy and communication science. Some empirical data on this, gathered from random number plots, is presented as of possible heuristic value. ?? 1971.},

This has occurred independently in four of the 14 avian orders examined to date, although the adaptive significance of this is currently unknown. \textcopyright{} 2007 by The University of Chicago.},

  abstract = {The Nepenthes species are carnivorous plants that have evolved a specialized leaf organ, the 'pitcher', to attract, capture, and digest insects. The digested insects provide nutrients for growth, allowing these plants to grow even in poor soil. Several proteins have been identified in the pitcher fluid, including aspartic proteases (nepenthesin I and II) and pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins ({$\beta$}-1,3-glucanase, class IV chitinase, and thaumatin-like protein). In this study, we collected and concentrated pitcher fluid to identify minor proteins. In addition, we tried to identify the protein secreted in response to trapping the insect. To make a similar situation in which the insect falls into the pitcher, chitin which was a major component of the insect exoskeleton was added to the fluid in the pitcher. Three PR proteins, class III peroxidase (Prx), {$\beta$}-1,3-glucanase, and class III chitinase, were newly identified. Prx was induced after the addition of chitin to the pitcher fluid. Proteins in the pitcher fluid of the carnivorous plant Nepenthes alata probably have two roles in nutrient supply: digestion of prey and the antibacterial effect. These results suggest that the system for digesting prey has evolved from the defense system against pathogens in the carnivorous plant Nepenthes. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

FLB includes a sensory-motor system, a conceptual-intentional system, and the computational mechanisms for recursion, providing the capacity to generate an infinite range of expressions from a finite set of elements. We hypothesize that FLN only includes recursion and is the only uniquely human component of the faculty of language. We further argue that FLN may have evolved for reasons other than language, hence comparative studies might look for evidence of such computations outside of the domain of communication (for example, number, navigation, and social relations).},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is the most important source of genetic variation in higher eukaryotes. It is initiated by formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in chromosomal DNA in early meiotic prophase. The DSBs are subsequently repaired, resulting in crossovers (COs) and noncrossovers (NCOs). Recombination events are not distributed evenly along chromosomes but cluster at recombination hotspots. How specific sites become hotspots is poorly understood. Studies in yeast and mammals linked initiation of meiotic recombination to active chromatin features present upstream from genes, such as absence of nucleosomes and presence of trimethylation of lysine 4 in histone H3 (H3K4me3). Core recombination components are conserved among eukaryotes, but it is unclear whether this conservation results in universal characteristics of recombination landscapes shared by a wide range of species. To address this question, we mapped meiotic DSBs in maize, a higher eukaryote with a large genome that is rich in repetitive DNA. We found DSBs in maize to be frequent in all chromosome regions, including sites lacking COs, such as centromeres and pericentromeric regions. Furthermore, most DSBs are formed in repetitive DNA, predominantly Gypsy retrotransposons, and only one-quarter of DSB hotspots are near genes. Genic and nongenic hotspots differ in several characteristics, and only genic DSBs contribute to crossover formation. Maize hotspots overlap regions of low nucleosome occupancy but show only limited association with H3K4me3 sites. Overall, maize DSB hotspots exhibit distribution patterns and characteristics not reported previously in other species. Understanding recombination patterns in maize will shed light on mechanisms affecting dynamics of the plant genome.},

Several types of molecular markers, such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), have been identified and effectively used in plant breeding. The application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has led to remarkable advances in whole genome sequencing, which provides ultra-throughput sequences to revolutionize plant genotyping and breeding. To further broaden NGS usages to large crop genomes such as maize and wheat, genotyping by sequencing (GBS) has been developed and applied in sequencing multiplexed samples that combine molecular marker discovery and genotyping. GBS is a novel application of NGS protocols for discovering and genotyping SNPs in crop genomes and populations. The GBS approach includes the digestion of genomic DNA with restriction enzymes followed by the ligation of barcode adapter, PCR amplification and sequencing of the amplified DNA pool on a single lane of flow cells. Bioinformatic pipelines are needed to analyze and interpret GBS datasets. As an ultimate MAS tool and a cost-effective technique, GBS has been successfully used in implementing genome-wide association study (GWAS), genomic diversity study, genetic linkage analysis, molecular marker discovery and genomic selection (GS) under a large scale of plant breeding programs.},

In maize we have found that a high degree of genetic variability is present, even among domestic inbred lines. Most randomly chosen maize cDNA clones can be used to detect elements of this variability. Similar levels of polymorphism are observed when genomic DNA is digested with any of a number of different restriction enzymes and probed with individual clones. When a clone is hybridized to genomic DNAs prepared from several different maize lines, a number of different alleles are often detected at a single locus. At the same time one clone can often detect more than one independently segregating locus by cross hybridization to related sequences at other loci. As expected these markers are inherited as simple codominant Mendelian alleles from one generation to the next and colinkage of these markers can be demonstrated in the progeny from a heterozygous parent. In similar studies with tomato, remarkably different results were found. Few RFPs were demonstrable among domestic Lycopersicon esculentum lines although a higher level of variability could be detected when comparing esculentum with its wild Lycopersicon relatives. These results are discussed in relation to the applied uses of RFPs in plant breeding as well as the inherent variability of different plant genomes.},

In yeast, hotspots tend to occur in promoter regions of genes, whereas in humans and mice, hotspots are largely defined by binding sites of the positive-regulatory domain zinc finger protein 9. To investigate the detailed recombination pattern in a flowering plant, we use shotgun resequencing of a wild population of the monkeyflower Mimulus guttatus to precisely locate over 400,000 boundaries of historic crossovers or gene conversion tracts. Their distribution defines some 13,000 hotspots of varying strengths, interspersed with cold regions of undetectably low recombination. Average recombination rates peak near starts of genes and fall off sharply, exhibiting polarity. Within genes, recombination tracts are more likely to terminate in exons than in introns. The general pattern is similar to that observed in yeast, as well as in positive-regulatory domain zinc finger protein 9\textendash knockout mice, suggesting that recombination initiation described here in Mimulus may reflect ancient and conserved eukaryotic mechanisms.},

CO frequency has a profound effect on patterns of genetic variation and species evolution. Relative CO rates vary extensively both within and between plant genomes. Plant genome size varies by over 1000-fold, largely due to differential expansion of repetitive sequences, and increased genome size is associated with reduced CO frequency. Gene versus repeat sequences associate with distinct chromatin modifications, and evidence from plant genomes indicates that this epigenetic information influences CO patterns. This is consistent with data from diverse eukaryotes that demonstrate the importance of chromatin structure for control of meiotic recombination. In this review I will discuss CO frequency patterns in plant genomes and recent advances in understanding recombination distributions.},

  abstract = {Sexual eukaryotes reproduce via the meiotic cell division, where ploidy is halved and homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal genetic exchange, termed crossover (CO). CO frequency has a profound effect on patterns of genetic variation and species evolution. Relative CO rates vary extensively both within and between plant genomes. Plant genome size varies by over 1000-fold, largely due to differential expansion of repetitive sequences, and increased genome size is associated with reduced CO frequency. Gene versus repeat sequences associate with distinct chromatin modifications, and evidence from plant genomes indicates that this epigenetic information influences CO patterns. This is consistent with data from diverse eukaryotes that demonstrate the importance of chromatin structure for control of meiotic recombination. In this review I will discuss CO frequency patterns in plant genomes and recent advances in understanding recombination distributions.},

  abstract = {Recent debates about memetics have revealed some widespread misunderstandings about Darwinian approaches to cultural evolution. Drawing from these debates, this paper disputes five common claims: (1) mental representations are rarely discrete, and therefore models that assume discrete, gene-like particles (i.e., replicators) are useless; (2) replicators are necessary for cumulative, adaptive evolution; (3) content-dependent psychological biases are the only important processes that affect the spread of cultural representations; (4) the "cultural fitness" of a mental representation can be inferred from its successful transmission; and (5) selective forces only matter if the sources of variation are random. We close by sketching the outlines of a unified evolutionary science of culture. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {Background and Aims Polyploidy is arguably the single most important genetic mechanism in plant speciation and diversification. It has been repeatedly suggested that polyploids show higher vegetative reproduction than diploids (to by-pass low fertility after the polyploidization), but there are no rigorous tests of it.Methods Data were analysed by phylogenetic regressions of clonal growth parameters, and vegetative reproduction in culture on the ploidy status of a large set of species (approx. 900) from the Central European Angiosperm flora. Further, correlated evolution of ploidy and clonal traits was examined to determine whether or not polyploidy precedes vegetative reproduction.Key Results The analyses showed that polyploidy is strongly associated with vegetative reproduction, whereas diploids rely more on seed reproduction. The rate of polyploid speciation is strongly enhanced by the existence of vegetative reproduction (namely extensive lateral spread), whereas the converse is not true.Conclusions These findings confirm the old hypothesis that polyploids can rely on vegetative reproduction which thus may save many incipient polyploids from extinction. A closer analysis also shows that the sequence of events begins with development of vegetative reproduction, which is then followed by polyploidy. Vegetative reproduction is thus likely to play an important role in polyploid speciation.},

Caninae) originated by allopolyploidy and are characterized by unbalanced meiosis producing polyploid egg cells (usually 4x) and haploid sperm cells (1x). In extant natural stands species hybridize spontaneously, but the extent of natural hybridization is unknown. The aim of the study was to document the frequency of reciprocal hybridization between the subsections Rubigineae and Caninae with special reference to the contribution of unreduced egg cells (5x) producing 6x offspring after fertilization with reduced (1x) sperm cells. We tested whether hybrids arose by independent multiple events or via a single or few incidences followed by a subsequent spread of hybrids.Methods Population genetics of 45 mixed stands of dog roses across central and south-eastern Europe were analysed using microsatellite markers and flow cytometry. Hybrids were recognized by the presence of diagnostic alleles and multivariate statistics were used to display the relationships between parental species and hybrids.Key Results Among plants classified to subsect. Rubigineae, 32\,\% hybridogenic individuals were detected but only 8\,\% hybrids were found in plants assigned to subsect. Caninae. This bias between reciprocal crossings was accompanied by a higher ploidy level in Rubigineae hybrids, which originated more frequently by unreduced egg cells. Genetic patterns of hybrids were strongly geographically structured, supporting their independent origin.Conclusions The biased crossing barriers between subsections are explained by the facilitated production of unreduced gametes in subsect. Rubigineae. Unreduced egg cells probably provide the highly homologous chromosome sets required for correct chromosome pairing in hybrids. Furthermore, the higher frequency of Rubigineae hybrids is probably influenced by abundance effects because the plants of subsect. Caninae are much more abundant and thus provide large quantities of pollen. Hybrids are formed spontaneously, leading to highly diverse mixed stands, which are insufficiently characterized by the actual taxonomy.},

  abstract = {When the nerves of isolated frog sartorius muscles were stimulated at 10 Hz, synaptic vesicles in the motor nerve terminals became transiently depleted. This depletion apparently resulted from a redistribution rather than disappearance of synaptic vesicle membrane, since the total amount of membrane comprising these nerve terminals remained constant during stimulation. At 1 min of stimulation, the 30\% depletion in synaptic vesicle membrane was nearly balanced by an increase in plasma membrane, suggesting that vesicle membrane rapidly moved to the surface as it might if vesicles released their content of transmitter by exocytosis. After 15 min of stimulation, the 60\% depletion of synaptic vesicle membrane was largely balanced by the appearance of numerous irregular membrane-walled cisternae inside the terminals, suggesting that vesicle membrane was retrieved from the surface as cisternae. When muscles were rested after 15 min of stimulation, cisternae disappeared and synaptic vesicles reappeared, suggesting that cisternae divided to form new synaptic vesicles so that the original vesicle membrane was now recycled into new synaptic vesicles. When muscles were soaked in horseradish peroxidase (HRP), this tracerfirst entered the cisternae which formed during stimulation and then entered a large proportion of the synaptic vesicles which reappeared during rest, strengthening the idea that synaptic vesicle membrane added to the surface was retrieved as cisternae which subsequently divided to form new vesicles. When muscles containing HRP in synaptic vesicles were washed to remove extracellular HRP and restimulated, HRP disappeared from vesicles without appearing in the new cisternae formed during the second stimulation, confirming that a one-way recycling of synaptic membrane, from the surface through cisternae to new vesicles, was occurring. Coated vesicles apparently represented the actual mechanism for retrieval of synaptic vesicle membrane from the plasma membrane, because during nerve stimulation they proliferated at regions of the nerve terminals covered by Schwann processes, took up peroxidase, and appeared in various stages of coalescence with cisternae. In contrast, synaptic vesicles did not appear to return directly from the surface to form cisternae, and cisternae themselves never appeared directly connected to the surface. Thus, during stimulation the intracellular compartments of this synapse change shape and take up extracellular protein in a manner which indicates that synaptic vesicle membrane added to the surface during exocytosis is retrieved by coated vesicles and recycled into new synaptic vesicles by way of intermediate cisternae.},

  abstract = {This chapter contains a detailed description of the immunological and cytological techniques developed to determine factors involved in crossover control during meiosis in barley. The immunological technique involves digesting fresh anthers followed by chromosome spreading to remove cytoplasm that causes unwanted background, whilst protecting the fragile chromosome structure from being compromised. Specific antibodies raised against meiotic proteins are then incubated with nuclei, detected with secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescent dyes, and visualized with either wide-field or confocal microscopes. In the cytological technique, barley inflorescences are fixed, followed by dissecting out the anthers, digesting the cell walls and then spreading the meiotic chromosomes. Both techniques can be used in conjunction with specific DNA probes for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to label telomeres, centromeres, and ribosomal DNA; to identify DNA modifications such as 5-methylcytosine; and to detect the incorporation of DNA base analogues such as 5-bromo-2{${'}$}-deoxyuridine (BrdU) or 5-ethynyl-2{${'}$}-deoxyuridine (EdU) to be used for a meiotic time-course or assaying newly synthesized DNA. Although these techniques have been specifically developed for barley, they should be directly transferable to other cereal crop species such as wheat and rice.},

In cereals, the distribution of genetic crossovers, cytologically visible as chiasmata, is skewed toward the distal regions of the chromosomes. However, many genes are known to lie within interstitial/proximal regions of low recombination, creating a limitation for breeders. We investigated the factors underlying the pattern of chiasma formation in barley (Hordeum vulgare) and show that chiasma distribution reflects polarization in the spatiotemporal initiation of recombination, chromosome pairing, and synapsis. Consequently, meiotic progression in distal chromosomal regions occurs in coordination with the chromatin cycles that are a conserved feature of the meiotic program. Recombination initiation in interstitial and proximal regions occurs later than distal events, is not coordinated with the cycles, and rarely progresses to form chiasmata. Early recombination initiation is spatially associated with early replicating, euchromatic DNA, which is predominately found in distal regions. We demonstrate that a modest temperature shift is sufficient to alter meiotic progression in relation to the chromosome cycles. The polarization of the meiotic processes is reduced and is accompanied by a shift in chiasma distribution with an increase in interstitial and proximal chiasmata, suggesting a potential route to modify recombination in cereals.},

  abstract = {The importance of ionic movements in excitable tissues has been emphasized by a number of recent experiments. On the one hand, there is the finding that the nervous impulse is associated with an inflow of sodium and an outflow of potassiuim (e.g. Rothenberg, 1950; Keynes \& Lewis, 1951). On the other, there are experiments which show that the rate of rise and amplitude of the action potential are determined by the concentration of sodium in the external medium (e.g. Hodgkin \& Katz, 1949a; Huxley \& Stiimpffi, 1951). Both groups of experiments are consistent with the theory that nervous conduction depends on a specific increase in permeability which allows sodium ions to move from the more concentrated solution outside a nerve fibre to the more dilute solution inside it. This movement of charge makes the inside of the fibre positive and provides a satisfactory explanation for the rising phase of the spike. Repolarization during the falling phase probably depends on an outflow of potassium ions and may be accelerated by a process which increases the potassium permeability after the action potential has reached its crest},

The authors show that this competitive advantage has both short-term and long-term consequences for territorial males. Following an encounter that was signaled for some males but not for their opponents, each winner and loser was forced to defend its territory against a novel male in an unsignaled encounter 3 days later. Males for which the first contest was signaled not only were more likely to defeat their rivals than control males but, having won that encounter, they also were more likely to win a second contest than fish that had lost their first encounter. All losers lost their second contest. These results are discussed in light of well-documented neuroendocrinological changes associated with winning and losing aggressive contests in territorial males.

  abstract = {The molecular clock presents a means of estimating evolutionary rates and timescales using genetic data. These estimates can lead to important insights into evolutionary processes and mechanisms, as well as providing a framework for further biological analyses. To deal with rate variation among genes and among lineages, a diverse range of molecular-clock methods have been developed. These methods have been implemented in various software packages and differ in their statistical properties, ability to handle different models of rate variation, capacity to incorporate various forms of calibrating information and tractability for analysing large data sets. Choosing a suitable molecular-clock model can be a challenging exercise, but a number of model-selection techniques are available. In this review, we describe the different forms of evolutionary rate heterogeneity and explain how they can be accommodated in molecular-clock analyses. We provide an outline of the various clock methods and models that are available, including the strict clock, local clocks, discrete clocks and relaxed clocks. Techniques for calibration and clock-model selection are also described, along with methods for handling multilocus data sets. We conclude our review with some comments about the future of molecular clocks.},

  abstract = {The evolutionary significance of hybridization and subsequent introgression has long been appreciated, but evaluation of the genome-wide effects of these phenomena has only recently become possible. Crop-wild study systems represent ideal opportunities to examine evolution through hybridization. For example, maize and the conspecific wild teosinte Zea mays ssp. mexicana (hereafter, mexicana) are known to hybridize in the fields of highland Mexico. Despite widespread evidence of gene flow, maize and mexicana maintain distinct morphologies and have done so in sympatry for thousands of years. Neither the genomic extent nor the evolutionary importance of introgression between these taxa is understood. In this study we assessed patterns of genome-wide introgression based on 39,029 single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in 189 individuals from nine sympatric maize-mexicana populations and reference allopatric populations. While portions of the maize and mexicana genomes appeared resistant to introgression (notably near known cross-incompatibility and domestication loci), we detected widespread evidence for introgression in both directions of gene flow. Through further characterization of these genomic regions and preliminary growth chamber experiments, we found evidence suggestive of the incorporation of adaptive mexicana alleles into maize during its expansion to the highlands of central Mexico. In contrast, very little evidence was found for adaptive introgression from maize to mexicana. The methods we have applied here can be replicated widely, and such analyses have the potential to greatly inform our understanding of evolution through introgressive hybridization. Crop species, due to their exceptional genomic resources and frequent histories of spread into sympatry with relatives, should be particularly influential in these studies.},

  abstract = {Motivation: An accurate genome assembly from short read sequencing data is critical for downstream analysis, for example allowing investigation of variants within a sequenced population. However, assembling sequencing data from virus samples, especially RNA viruses, into a genome sequence is challenging due to the combination of viral population diversity and extremely uneven read depth caused by amplification bias in the inevitable reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction amplification process of current methods., Results: We developed a new de novo assembler called IVA (Iterative Virus Assembler) designed specifically for read pairs sequenced at highly variable depth from RNA virus samples. We tested IVA on datasets from 140 sequenced samples from human immunodeficiency virus-1 or influenza-virus-infected people and demonstrated that IVA outperforms all other virus de novo assemblers., Availability and implementation: The software runs under Linux, has the GPLv3 licence and is freely available from http://sanger-pathogens.github.io/iva, Contact: iva@sanger.ac.uk, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Extensive horizontal transfer has occurred for operational genes (those involved in housekeeping), whereas informational genes (those involved in transcription, translation, and related processes) are seldomly horizontally transferred. Through phylogenetic analysis of six complete prokaryotic genomes and the identification of 312 sets of orthologous genes present in all six genomes, we tested two theories describing the temporal flow of horizontal transfer. We show that operational genes have been horizontally transferred continuously since the divergence of the prokaryotes, rather than having been exchanged in one, or a few, massive events that occurred early in the evolution of prokaryotes. In agreement with earlier studies, we found that differences in rates of evolution between operational and informational genes are minimal, suggesting that factors other than rate of evolution are responsible for the observed differences in horizontal transfer. We propose that a major factor in the more frequent horizontal transfer of operational genes is that informational genes are typically members of large, complex systems, whereas operational genes are not, thereby making horizontal transfer of informational gene products less probable (the complexity hypothesis).},

Analysis of microarray data is however very complex, requiring sophisticated methods to control for various factors that are inherent to the procedures used. In this article we describe the individual steps of a microarray experiment, highlighting important elements and factors that may affect the processes involved and that influence the interpretation of the results. Additionally, we describe methods that can be used to estimate the influence of these factors, and to control the way in which they affect the expression estimates. A comprehensive understanding of the experimental protocol used in a microarray experiment aids the interpretation of the obtained results. By describing known factors which affect expression estimates this article provides guidelines for appropriate quality control and pre-processing of the data, additionally applicable to other transcriptome analysis methods that utilize similar sample handling protocols.},

  abstract = {Chenopodium quinoa (quinoa) is a highly nutritious grain identified as an important crop to improve world food security. Unfortunately, few resources are available to facilitate its genetic improvement. Here we report the assembly of a high-quality, chromosome-scale reference genome sequence for quinoa, which was produced using single-molecule real-time sequencing in combination with optical, chromosome-contact and genetic maps. We also report the sequencing of two diploids from the ancestral gene pools of quinoa, which enables the identification of sub-genomes in quinoa, and reduced-coverage genome sequences for 22 other samples of the allotetraploid goosefoot complex. The genome sequence facilitated the identification of the transcription factor likely to control the production of anti-nutritional triterpenoid saponins found in quinoa seeds, including a mutation that appears to cause alternative splicing and a premature stop codon in sweet quinoa strains. These genomic resources are an important first step towards the genetic improvement of quinoa.},

Two loci, o (orange lemma) and Amyl ({$\alpha$}-amylase isoenzyme), 27\% recombination apart, were used in both tests. Locus nec2 (necrotic leaf spotting), or a breakpoint in translocation T4-6a, both closely linked with locus o, constituted the third marker point. Significant differences between the estimated recombination frequencies at the three temperatures were not found. If temperature has an effect on the recombination frequency, it is apparently of no importance for mapping gene loci or for barley breeding. However, the recombination frequency may be affected more by temperature when a translocation is involved. A reduced pollen sterility at 12\textdegree C was found in the translocation heterozygote; it may be caused by an increased frequency of alternate orientation of the translocation quadrivalent.},

  abstract = {Recombination affects the fate of alleles in populations by imposing constraints on the reshuffling of genetic information. Understanding the genetic basis of these constraints is critical for manipulating the recombination process to improve the resolution of genetic mapping, and reducing the negative effects of linkage drag and deleterious genetic load in breeding. Using sequence-based genotyping of a wheat nested association mapping (NAM) population of 2,100 recombinant inbred lines created by crossing 29 diverse lines, we mapped QTL affecting the distribution and frequency of 102 000 crossovers (CO). Genome-wide recombination rate variation was mostly defined by rare alleles with small effects together explaining up to 48.6\% of variation. Most QTL were additive and showed predominantly trans-acting effects. The QTL affecting the proximal COs also acted additively without increasing the frequency of distal COs. We showed that the regions with decreased recombination carry more single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with possible deleterious effects than the regions with a high recombination rate. Therefore, our study offers insights into the genetic basis of recombination rate variation in wheat and its effect on the distribution of deleterious SNPs across the genome. The identified trans-acting additive QTL can be utilized to manipulate CO frequency and distribution in the large polyploid wheat genome opening the possibility to improve the efficiency of gene pyramiding and reducing the deleterious genetic load in the low-recombining pericentromeric regions of chromosomes.},

  abstract = {1. Scientists have been fascinated by carnivorous plants for centuries and they have thoroughly investigated how these plants can benefit from insect capture for example through increased growth, earlier flowering, and increased seed production. How prey is actually lured into the traps, however, is less well understood. Trapping prey may be achieved in a random way, for example by camouflaging the traps (hiding them in the surrounding vegetation), so that prey is trapped by accidental landing on the trap leaves or wind drift, or in the other extreme, trapping may involve mimicry of other attractive resources such as fruits or flowers by using specific visual or olfactory signals to attract a specific prey assemblage. 2. We investigated for the first time volatiles of the trapping leaves of carnivorous plant species by dynamic headspace methods. We present data on the venus flytrap Dionaea muscipula, the sundew Drosera binata, and the North American pitcher plants Sarracenia flava, Sarracenia leucophylla, Sarracenia minor, and Sarracenia purpurea. A large number of compounds and relatively high emission rates were found in three of the North American pitcher plants (S. flava, S. leucophylla, and S. minor) with compounds typically found in flowers or fruits. This suggests together with other features (e.g. colour, nectar production) that these traps are possibly flower or fruit mimics. The leaves of S. purpurea, Dionaea muscipula, and Drosera binata emitted much weaker scents with lower numbers of components, consisting mainly of volatiles typically emitted from green leaves. 3. We discuss whether or not the use of volatiles for attracting prey animals is linked with specific trapping mechanisms and whether carnivorous plants can be grouped into specialized `olfactory syndromes'.},

We caught 1871 individuals representing 49 species of three families (Emballonuridae, Phyllostomidae, Vespertilionidae). Capture effort, totaling 1955.5 mistnet hours in several cycles over a two-year period, was similar for ground and canopy nets. The canopy rigs yielded more species (n = 41) than the ground nets (n = 35), but both samples were characterized by rank abundance curves with similar shape and with a dominance of frugivores (Phyllostomidae). Nearly half (n = 24) of the species were captured in numbers too small (n \textbackslash textless 6) to allow firm classification, but differences in capture frequencies of some of the better-sampled species in high and low nets reveal vertical stratification. Species-specific differences in diet, foraging strategies, roost sites, and sampling bias contribute to this pattern. As a result of the differential use of space among bats, alterations of forest structure are likely to result in changes in structure and function of local bat communities, but our limited knowledge of natural history and ecology of many species limits definition of changes. We see a critical need for further research into the extent to which habitat complexity influences species richness and abundance of bats. This information is especially important in view of the need to develop and apply conservation-oriented programs to maintain biodiversity. A review of recent improvements in techniques for inventorying bats shows that a combination of methods, including mistnetting and acoustic monitoring, is mandatory for such studies.

  abstract = {Background and Aims Allopolyploids exhibit both different levels and different patterns of genetic variation than are typical of diploids. However, scant attention has been given to the partitioning of allelic information and diversity in allopolyploids, particularly that among homeologous monoploid components of the hologenome. Sphagnum \texttimes{} falcatulum is a double allopolyploid peat moss that spans a considerable portion of the Holantarctic. With monoploid genomes from three ancestral species, this organism exhibits a complex evolutionary history involving serial inter-subgeneric allopolyploidizations.Methods Studying populations from three disjunct regions [South Island (New Zealand); Tierra de Fuego archipelago (Chile, Argentina); Tasmania (Australia)], allelic information for five highly stable microsatellite markers that differed among the three (ancestral) monoploid genomes was examined. Using Shannon information and diversity measures, the holoploid information, as well as the information within and among the three component monoploid genomes, was partitioned into separate components for individuals within and among populations and regions, and those information components were then converted into corresponding diversity measures.Key Results The majority (76~\%) of alleles detected across these five markers are most likely to have been captured by hybridization, but the information within each of the three monoploid genomes varied, suggesting a history of recurrent allopolyploidization between ancestral species containing different levels of genetic diversity. Information within individuals, equivalent to the information among monoploid genomes (for this dataset), was relatively stable, and represented 83~\% of the grand total information across the Holantarctic, with both inter-regional and inter-population diversification each accounting for about 5~\% of the total information.ConclusionsSphagnum \texttimes falcatulum probably inherited the great majority of its genetic diversity at these markers by reticulation, rather than by subsequent evolutionary radiation. However, some post-hybridization genetic diversification has become fixed in at least one regional population. Methodology allowing statistical analysis of any ploidy level is presented.},

  abstract = {In natural environments where food abundance and quality can change drastically over time, animals must continuously alter their food acquisition strategies. Although genetic variation contributes to this plasticity, the specific genes involved and their interactions with the environment are poorly understood. Here we report that natural variation in the Drosophila gene, foraging (for), which encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), affects larval food acquisition in an environmentally dependent fashion. When food is plentiful, the wild-type rover (for(R)) allele confers lower food intake and higher glucose absorption than both the wild-type sitter (for(s)) allele and the mutant for(s2) allele. When food is scarce, for(R), for(s) and for(s2) larvae increase food intake to a common maximal level, but for(R) larvae retain their increased absorption efficiency. Changes in for expression can induce corrective behavioral modifications in response to food deprivation. When reared in environments with low food levels, for(R) larvae have higher survivorship and faster development than for(s) and for(s2) larvae. Together, these results show that natural variation in for has far reaching implications affecting a suite of phenotypes involved in the regulation of food acquisition.},

Regulatory mechanisms may be revealed through physiological and molecular characterization of naturally occurring and induced tillering mutants in the major crops.

The reduced tillering in tin is due to early cessation of tiller bud outgrowth during the transition of the shoot apex from the vegetative to the reproductive stage.

  abstract = {It is known that the allele ancestral to the variation at a polymorphic site cannot be assigned with certainty, and that the most frequently used method to assign the ancestral state-maximum parsimony-is prone to misinference. Estimates of counts of sites that have a certain number of copies of the derived allele in a sample (the unfolded site frequency spectrum, uSFS) made by parsimony are therefore also biased. We previously developed a maximum likelihood method to estimate the uSFS for a focal species using information from two outgroups while assuming simple models of nucleotide substitution. Here, we extend this approach to allow multiple outgroups (implemented for three outgroups), potentially any phylogenetic tree topology, and more complex models of nucleotide substitution. We find, however, that two outgroups and the Kimura two-parameter model are adequate for uSFS inference in most cases. We show that using parsimony to infer the ancestral state at a specific site seriously breaks down in two situations. The first is where the outgroups provide no information about the ancestral state of variation in the focal species. In this case, nucleotide variation will be underestimated if such sites are excluded. The second is where the minor allele in the focal species agrees with the allelic state of the outgroups. In this situation, parsimony tends to overestimate the probability of the major allele being derived, because it fails to account for the fact that sites with a high frequency of the derived allele tend to be rare. We present a method that corrects this deficiency and is capable of providing nearly unbiased estimates of ancestral state probabilities on a site-by-site basis and the uSFS.},

In doing so we provide the first experimental validation for the idea that cultural transmission can lead to the appearance of design without a designer. Our experiments involve the iterated learning of artificial languages by human participants. We show that languages transmitted culturally evolve in such a way as to maximize their own transmissibility: over time, the languages in our experiments become easier to learn and increasingly structured. Furthermore, this structure emerges purely as a consequence of the transmission of language over generations, without any intentional design on the part of individual language learners. Previous computational and mathematical models suggest that iterated learning provides an explanation for the structure of human language and link particular aspects of linguistic structure with particular constraints acting on language during its transmission. The experimental work presented here shows that the predictions of these models, and models of cultural evolution more generally, can be tested in the laboratory.},

  abstract = {SUMMARYData from experiments with spring wheat, variety Kolibri, were used to examine size gradients within the mature ear in relation to ear development. The greatest number of grains and florets per spikelet, and the heaviest grains, occurred in the lower-mid part of the ear. Within the spikelets in this region grain 2 {$>$} grain 1 {$>$} grain 3.It is proposed that the timing and period of ear development and the number of spikelets can be described quantitatively in terms of (1) the rate of leaf initiation, (2) the number of leaves, (3) the rate of spikelet initiation and (4) the total number of primordia. Both leaf and spikelet initiation proceeded at more or less constant rates, but spikelet initiation was about three times as fast as leaf initiation. Differentiation of the spikelet primordia started at about the time the terminal spikelet was initiated, occurring first in the spikelets in lower-mid part of the ear. The rate of floret initiation was lower than that of spikelet initiation, but did not differ between spikelets. A maximum of nine florets per spikelet was formed and then, in all spikelets, some of the last-formed primordia died, leaving two to four potentially fertile florets.Morphologically, primordia in the lower-mid part of the ear were always the most advanced. The more rapid development of the terminal primordia tended to synchronize events such as meiosis and anthesis, thus shortening the development period of the later formed florets. Changes in meristem size were such that both length and diameter were the greatest when the primordia of the lower-mid part of the ear were initiated.The statistical model to describe primordium initiation and ear size is compared with other models describing primordium initiation rates. The analysis of ear development in quantitative terms is discussed in relation to analyses of ear development by morphological stages. A correlation between grain size and time of floret initiation is demonstrated and the significance of the size changes in the meristem is discussed.},

  abstract = {SUMMARYData from experiments with spring wheat, variety Kolibri, were used to examine size gradients within the mature ear in relation to ear development. The greatest number of grains and florets per spikelet, and the heaviest grains, occurred in the lower-mid part of the ear. Within the spikelets in this region grain 2 {$>$} grain 1 {$>$} grain 3.It is proposed that the timing and period of ear development and the number of spikelets can be described quantitatively in terms of (1) the rate of leaf initiation, (2) the number of leaves, (3) the rate of spikelet initiation and (4) the total number of primordia. Both leaf and spikelet initiation proceeded at more or less constant rates, but spikelet initiation was about three times as fast as leaf initiation. Differentiation of the spikelet primordia started at about the time the terminal spikelet was initiated, occurring first in the spikelets in lower-mid part of the ear. The rate of floret initiation was lower than that of spikelet initiation, but did not differ between spikelets. A maximum of nine florets per spikelet was formed and then, in all spikelets, some of the last-formed primordia died, leaving two to four potentially fertile florets.Morphologically, primordia in the lower-mid part of the ear were always the most advanced. The more rapid development of the terminal primordia tended to synchronize events such as meiosis and anthesis, thus shortening the development period of the later formed florets. Changes in meristem size were such that both length and diameter were the greatest when the primordia of the lower-mid part of the ear were initiated.The statistical model to describe primordium initiation and ear size is compared with other models describing primordium initiation rates. The analysis of ear development in quantitative terms is discussed in relation to analyses of ear development by morphological stages. A correlation between grain size and time of floret initiation is demonstrated and the significance of the size changes in the meristem is discussed.},

Experiments with human listeners were conducted to establish appropriate stimulus materials. Then, eight European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were trained to respond differentially to vowel tokens drawn from stylized distributions for the English vowels /i/ and /ɪ/, or from two distributions of vowel sounds that were orthogonal in the F1\textendash F2 plane. Following training, starlings' responses generalized with facility to novel stimuli drawn from these distributions. Responses could be predicted well on the bases of frequencies of the first two formants and distributional characteristics of experienced vowel sounds with a graded structure about the central ``prototypical'' vowel of the training distributions. Starling responses corresponded closely to adult human judgments of ``goodness'' for English vowel sounds. Finally, a simple linear association network model trained with vowels drawn from the avian training set provided a good account for the data. Findings suggest that little more than sensitivity to statistical regularities of language input (probability\textendash density distributions) together with organizational processes that serve to enhance distinctiveness may accommodate much of what is known about the functional equivalence of vowel sounds.},

Antiquity 69, 197-214] proposed a model designed to show that larger population size facilitates cumulative cultural evolution toward higher skill levels. In this model, each newborn attempts to imitate the most highly skilled individual of the parental generation by directly-biased social learning, but the skill level he/she acquires deviates probabilistically from that of the exemplar (cultural parent). The probability that the skill level of the imitator exceeds that of the exemplar can be regarded as the innovation rate. After reformulating Henrich's model rigorously, we introduce an overlapping-generations analog based on the Moran model and derive an approximate formula for the expected change per generation of the highest skill level in the population. For large population size, our overlapping-generations model predicts a much larger effect of population size than Henrich's discrete-generations model. We then investigate by way of Monte Carlo simulations the case where each newborn chooses as his/her exemplar the most highly skilled individual from among a limited number of acquaintances. When the number of acquaintances is small relative to the population size, we find that a change in the innovation rate contributes more than a proportional change in population size to the cumulative cultural evolution of skill level. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

  abstract = {For decades, linden trees (basswoods or lime trees), and particularly silver linden (Tilia tomentosa), have been linked to mass bee deaths. This phenomenon is often attributed to the purported occurrence of the carbohydrate mannose, which is toxic to bees, in Tilia nectar. In this review, however, we conclude that from existing literature there is no experimental evidence for toxicity to bees in linden nectar. Bee deaths on Tilia probably result from starvation, owing to insufficient nectar resources late in the tree's flowering period. We recommend ensuring sufficient alternative food sources in cities during late summer to reduce bee deaths on silver linden. Silver linden metabolites such as floral volatiles, pollen chemistry and nectar secondary compounds remain underexplored, particularly their toxic or behavioural effects on bees. Some evidence for the presence of caffeine in linden nectar may mean that linden trees can chemically deceive foraging bees to make sub-optimal foraging decisions, in some cases leading to their starvation.},

  abstract = {The identification of the genetic structure of populations from multilocus genotype data has become a central component of modern population-genetic data analysis. Application of model-based clustering programs often entails a number of steps, in which the user considers different modeling assumptions, compares results across different pre-determined values of the number of assumed clusters (a parameter typically denoted K), examines multiple independent runs for each fixed value of K, and distinguishes among runs belonging to substantially distinct clustering solutions. Here, we present Clumpak (Cluster Markov Packager Across K), a method that automates the post-processing of results of model-based population structure analyses. For analyzing multiple independent runs at a single K value, Clumpak identifies sets of highly similar runs, separating distinct groups of runs that represent distinct modes in the space of possible solutions. This procedure, which generates a consensus solution for each distinct mode, is performed by the use of a Markov clustering algorithm that relies on a similarity matrix between replicate runs, as computed by the software Clumpp. Next, Clumpak identifies an optimal alignment of inferred clusters across different values of K, extending a similar approach implemented for a fixed K in Clumpp, and simplifying the comparison of clustering results across different K values. Clumpak incorporates additional features, such as implementations of methods for choosing K and comparing solutions obtained by different programs, models, or data subsets. Clumpak, available at http://clumpak.tau.ac.il, simplifies the use of model-based analyses of population structure in population genetics and molecular ecology.},

Sex chromosomal distorters lead to biased sex ratios, and the presence of such distorters, therefore, may induce selection for a change in the mechanism of sex determination. The evolutionary dynamics of distorter-induced changes in sex determination has only been studied in some specific systems. Here, we present a generic model for this process. We consider three scenarios: a driving X chromosome, a driving Y chromosome and a driving autosome with a male-determining factor. We investigate how the invasion prospects of a new sex-determining factor are affected by the strength of distortion and the fitness effect of the distorting allele. Our models show that in many cases, segregation distortion does create selection pressure, allowing novel sex-determining alleles to spread. When distortion leads to female-biased sex ratios, a new masculinizing gene can invade, leading to a new male heterogametic system. When distortion leads to male-biased sex ratios, a feminizing factor can invade and cause a switch to female heterogamety. In many cases, the distorter-induced change in the sex-determining system eventually leads to loss of the distorter from the population. Hence, the presence of sex chromosomal distorters will often only be transient, and the distorters may remain unnoticed. The role of segregation distortion in the evolution of sex determination may, therefore, be underestimated.},

  abstract = {Comprehensive reverse genetic resources, which have been key to understanding gene function in diploid model organisms, are missing in many polyploid crops. Young polyploid species such as wheat, which was domesticated less than 10,000 y ago, have high levels of sequence identity among subgenomes that mask the effects of recessive alleles. Such redundancy reduces the probability of selection of favorable mutations during natural or human selection, but also allows wheat to tolerate high densities of induced mutations. Here we exploited this property to sequence and catalog more than 10 million mutations in the protein-coding regions of 2,735 mutant lines of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. We detected, on average, 2,705 and 5,351 mutations per tetraploid and hexaploid line, respectively, which resulted in 35\textendash 40 mutations per kb in each population.

  abstract = {Comprehensive reverse genetic resources, which have been key to understanding gene function in diploid model organisms, are missing in many polyploid crops. Young polyploid species such as wheat, which was domesticated less than 10,000 y ago, have high levels of sequence identity among subgenomes that mask the effects of recessive alleles. Such redundancy reduces the probability of selection of favorable mutations during natural or human selection, but also allows wheat to tolerate high densities of induced mutations. Here we exploited this property to sequence and catalog more than 10 million mutations in the protein-coding regions of 2,735 mutant lines of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. We detected, on average, 2,705 and 5,351 mutations per tetraploid and hexaploid line, respectively, which resulted in 35\textendash 40 mutations per kb in each population. With these mutation densities, we identified an average of 23\textendash 24 missense and truncation alleles per gene, with at least one truncation or deleterious missense mutation in more than 90\% of the captured wheat genes per population. This public collection of mutant seed stocks and sequence data enables rapid identification of mutations in the different copies of the wheat genes, which can be combined to uncover previously hidden variation.

  abstract = {DNA microarrays are devices that are able, in principle, to detect and quantify the presence of specific nucleic acid sequences in complex biological mixtures. The measurement consists in detecting fluorescence signals from several spots on the microarray surface onto which different probe sequences are grafted. One of the problems of the data analysis is that the signal contains a noisy background component due to nonspecific binding. We present a physical model for background estimation in Affymetrix Genechips. It combines two different approaches. The first is based on the sequence composition, specifically its sequence-dependent hybridization affinity. The second is based on the strong correlation of intensities from locations which are the physical neighbors of a specific spot on the chip. Both effects are incorporated in a background estimator which contains 24 free parameters, fixed by minimization on a training data set. In all data analyzed the sequence-specific parameters, obtained by minimization, are found to strongly correlate with empirically determined stacking free energies for RNA-DNA hybridization in solution. Moreover, there is an overall agreement with experimental background data and we show that the physics-based model that we propose performs on average better than purely statistical approaches for background calculations. The model thus provides an interesting alternative method for background subtraction schemes in Affymetrix Genechips.},

As maps of SNPs and the techniques for genotyping them are being developed, it is important to consider what properties such maps must have in order for them to be useful for linkage studies. I examine how polymorphic and densely spaced biallelic markers need to be for extraction of most of the inheritance information from human pedigrees, and compare maps of biallelics with today's genome-scanning sets of microsatellite markers.

  abstract = {Meiosis is a specialized cell division, essential in most reproducing organisms to halve the number of chromosomes, thereby enabling the restoration of ploidy levels during fertilization. A key step of meiosis is homologous recombination, which promotes homologous pairing and generates crossovers (COs) to connect homologous chromosomes until their separation at anaphase I. These CO sites, seen cytologically as chiasmata, represent a reciprocal exchange of genetic information between two homologous nonsister chromatids. This gene reshuffling during meiosis has a significant influence on evolution and also plays an essential role in plant breeding, because a successful breeding program depends on the ability to bring the desired combinations of alleles on chromosomes. However, the number and distribution of COs during meiosis is highly constrained. There is at least one CO per chromosome pair to ensure accurate segregation of homologs, but in most organisms, the CO number rarely exceeds three regardless of chromosome size. Moreover, their positions are not random on chromosomes but exhibit regional preference. Thus, genes in recombination-poor regions tend to be inherited together, hindering the generation of novel allelic combinations that could be exploited by breeding programs. Recently, much progress has been made in understanding meiotic recombination. In particular, many genes involved in the process in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) have been identified and analyzed. With the coming challenges of food security and climate change, and our enhanced knowledge of how COs are formed, the interest and needs in manipulating CO formation are greater than ever before. In this review, we focus on advances in understanding meiotic recombination and then summarize the attempts to manipulate CO formation. Last, we pay special attention to the meiotic recombination in polyploidy, which is a common genomic feature for many crop plants.},

  abstract = {Meiosis is a specialized cell division, essential in most reproducing organisms to halve the number of chromosomes, thereby enabling the restoration of ploidy levels during fertilization. A key step of meiosis is homologous recombination, which promotes homologous pairing and generates crossovers (COs) to connect homologous chromosomes until their separation at anaphase I. These CO sites, seen cytologically as chiasmata, represent a reciprocal exchange of genetic information between two homologous nonsister chromatids. This gene reshuffling during meiosis has a significant influence on evolution and also plays an essential role in plant breeding, because a successful breeding program depends on the ability to bring the desired combinations of alleles on chromosomes. However, the number and distribution of COs during meiosis is highly constrained. There is at least one CO per chromosome pair to ensure accurate segregation of homologs, but in most organisms, the CO number rarely exceeds three regardless of chromosome size. Moreover, their positions are not random on chromosomes but exhibit regional preference. Thus, genes in recombination-poor regions tend to be inherited together, hindering the generation of novel allelic combinations that could be exploited by breeding programs. Recently, much progress has been made in understanding meiotic recombination. In particular, many genes involved in the process in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) have been identified and analyzed. With the coming challenges of food security and climate change, and our enhanced knowledge of how COs are formed, the interest and needs in manipulating CO formation are greater than ever before. In this review, we focus on advances in understanding meiotic recombination and then summarize the attempts to manipulate CO formation. Last, we pay special attention to the meiotic recombination in polyploidy, which is a common genomic feature for many crop plants.},

The merits of molecular markers make them valuable tools in a range of research areas. This review describes novel approaches based on modern molecular marker technologies for characterization and utilization of genetic variation for wheat improvement. Large-scale genome characterization by DNA-fingerprinting has revealed no declining trends in the molecular genetic diversity in wheat as a consequence of modern intensive breeding thus opposing the genetic `erosion' hypothesis. A great number of important major genes and quantitative trait loci have been mapped with molecular markers. Marker-assisted selection based on a tight linkage between a marker allele and a gene(s) governing a qualitative or quantitative trait is gaining considerable importance as it facilitates and accelerates cultivar improvement through precise transfer of chromosome regions carrying the gene of interest. The implementations of molecular markers in wheat genotyping, mapping and breeding complemented by specific approaches associated with the complex polyploid nature of common wheat are analyzed and presented.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims The genetic and morphological consequences of natural selection and selective breeding are explored in the genus Abelia. The genus consists of ornamental shrubs endemic to China, which have been bred to create attractive and diverse cultivars.Methods DNA fingerprinting (AFLP) and DNA sequence data are used to investigate the genetic diversity among 46 accessions of Abelia (22 natural taxa and 24 horticultural breeds). In the cultivated varieties these data are used to explore taxon boundaries, hybridisation and backcrossing. The genetic analysis dataset is also used to investigate morphological variation within natural species complexes and subsequently to inform a taxonomic treatment.Key ResultsAbelia comprises five species: A. forrestii, A. schumannii, A. macrotera, A. uniflora and A. chinensis and has a total of 11 varieties. Abelia uniflora and A. macrotera do not occur in sympatry and are disjunctly distributed to the east and west of the A. chinensis distribution range. Abelia chinensis is widespread in eastern China and creates hybrids and introgressive taxa, including A. uniflora, along the contact zones with the previous taxa. Abelia `Maurice Foster' is a horticultural variety collected from wild stocks in Sichuan (China). Bayesian clustering methods (inferred in STRUCTURE based on AFLP data) indicate admixture between A. macrotera and A. schumannii in this variety. Hybridization probably occurred in the wild where these progenitor taxa co-occur and naturally form hybrids. AFLP results also reveal that a few diagnostic morphological characters such as sepal number or inflorescence structure were transferred between natural species and this is mirrored by taxa such as in Abelia `Saxon Gold' and A. forrestii.Conclusions Studying both natural and cultivated species from the same group has helped understanding both differentiation mechanisms and how to improve cultivated plants in the future by studying which morphological characters are transferred between species and which taxa may already have arisen through hybridisation.},

But soup is homogeneous in pH and redox potential, and so has no capacity for energy coupling by chemiosmosis. Thermodynamic constraints make chemiosmosis strictly necessary for carbon and energy metabolism in all free-living chemotrophs, and presumably the first free-living cells too. Proton gradients form naturally at alkaline hydrothermal vents and are viewed as central to the origin of life. Here we consider how the earliest cells might have harnessed a geochemically created proton-motive force and then learned to make their own, a transition that was necessary for their escape from the vents. Synthesis of ATP by chemiosmosis today involves generation of an ion gradient by means of vectorial electron transfer from a donor to an acceptor. We argue that the first donor was hydrogen and the first acceptor CO2.},

  abstract = {Segregation Distorter (SD) is an autosomal meiotic drive gene complex found worldwide in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. During spermatogenesis, SD induces dysfunction of SD+ spermatids so that SD/SD+ males sire almost exclusively SD-bearing progeny rather than the expected 1:1 Mendelian ratio. SD is thus evolutionarily ``selfish,'' enhancing its own transmission at the expense of its bearers. Here we review the molecular and evolutionary genetics of SD. Genetic analyses show that the SD is a multilocus gene complex involving two key loci\textemdash the driver, Segregation distorter (Sd), and the target of drive, Responder (Rsp)\textemdash and at least three upward modifiers of distortion. Molecular analyses show that Sd encodes a truncated duplication of the gene RanGAP, whereas Rsp is a large pericentromeric block of satellite DNA. The Sd\textendash RanGAP protein is enzymatically wild type but mislocalized within cells and, for reasons that remain unclear, appears to disrupt the histone-to-protamine transition in drive-sensitive spermatids bearing many Rsp satellite repeats but not drive-insensitive spermatids bearing few or no Rsp satellite repeats. Evolutionary analyses show that the Sd\textendash RanGAP duplication arose recently within the D. melanogaster lineage, exploiting the preexisting and considerably older Rsp satellite locus. Once established, the SD haplotype collected enhancers of distortion and suppressors of recombination. Further dissection of the molecular genetic and cellular basis of SD-mediated distortion seems likely to provide insights into several important areas currently understudied, including the genetic control of spermatogenesis, the maintenance and evolution of satellite DNAs, the possible roles of small interfering RNAs in the germline, and the molecular population genetics of the interaction of genetic linkage and natural selection.},

Although laboratory studies have found evidence of cross-immunity, immunosuppression and competition, analyses of hosts in the field have generally concluded that parasite communities are little more than random assemblages. Here we present evidence of consistent interspecific interactions in a natural mammalian system, revealed through the analysis of parasite intensity data collected from a free-ranging rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) population, sampled monthly for a period of 23 yr. The wild rabbit plays host to a diverse gut helminth community that reflects the communities seen in other economically important domestic herbivores. These findings suggest that parasite interactions could have profound implications for the dynamics of parasite communities. The efficacy of parasite control programmes could be jeopardized if such interactions are not taken into account. In contrast, a clear understanding of such interactions may provide the basis for the development of more environmentally acceptable methods of parasite control.},

  abstract = {Standard protein substitution models use a single amino acid replacement rate matrix that summarizes the biological, chemical and physical properties of amino acids. However, site evolution is highly heterogeneous and depends on many factors: genetic code; solvent exposure; secondary and tertiary structure; protein function; etc. These impact the substitution pattern and, in most cases, a single replacement matrix is not enough to represent all the complexity of the evolutionary processes. This paper explores in maximum-likelihood framework phylogenetic mixture models that combine several amino acid replacement matrices to better fit protein evolution. We learn these mixture models from a large alignment database extracted from HSSP, and test the performance using independent alignments from TreeBase. We compare unsupervised learning approaches, where the site categories are unknown, to supervised ones, where in estimations we use the known category of each site, based on its exposure or its secondary structure. All our models are combined with gamma-distributed rates across sites. Results show that highly significant likelihood gains are obtained when using mixture models compared with the best available single replacement matrices. Mixtures of matrices also improve over mixtures of profiles in the manner of the CAT model. The unsupervised approach tends to be better than the supervised one, but it appears difficult to implement and highly sensitive to the starting values of the parameters, meaning that the supervised approach is still of interest for initialization and model comparison. Using an unsupervised model involving three matrices, the average AIC gain per site with TreeBase test alignments is 0.31, 0.49 and 0.61 compared with LG (named after Le \& Gascuel 2008 Mol. Biol. Evol. 25, 1307\textendash 1320), WAG and JTT, respectively. This three-matrix model is significantly better than LG for 34 alignments (among 57), and significantly worse for 1 alignment only. Moreover, tree topologies inferred with our mixture models frequently differ from those obtained with single matrices, indicating that using these mixtures impacts not only the likelihood value but also the output tree.

Especially the high abundance of Anisakis larvae in the fish flesh is of concern regarding the possible intensified utilisation of Grey Gurnard as a food resource. To gain better knowledge of the nematode burden with emphasis on abundance and distribution in the fish flesh, various Grey gurnards from 6 localities across the North Sea, each representing either western, northern or eastern fishing grounds, were examined for anisakid nematodes during summer of 2010 and 2012. The overall prevalence of A.simplex (s.l.) larvae in the gurnards from all localities (n=188) was nearly total, i.e. only a single fish from the northernmost locality (Viking Bank) was apparently not infected. GLM-analyses revealed that catching locality had by far the strongest effect on larval infection probability, both in total (flesh+viscera) and in the fish flesh, while body size (weight) was a weak but still significant predictor of overall A.simplex (s.l.) abundance, but not in the flesh. Thus, the overall larval abundance in the gurnards from the two western localities off the east-coast of British mainland was significantly higher compared to the other catching localities. In the former localities, the overall mean abundance of A.simplex (s.l.) larvae was 35.0??23.9 and 92.2??87.4, and ranged from 14 to 114 and 9 to 397, respectively. It was further shown that 93.8\% of the larvae infecting the fish flesh were situated in the belly flaps, i.e. the ventral portion of each flesh side or fillet, independent of catching locality and fish size. However, trimming of the fillets by removing the belly flaps may reduce the abundance in the fillets to, on an average, 0.3 larvae. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Key message Using two nested association mapping populations and high-density markers, some important genomic regions controlling recombination frequency and segregation distortion were detected. AbstractUnderstanding the maize genomic features would be useful for the study of genetic diversity and evolution and for maize breeding. Here, we used two maize nested association mapping (NAM) populations separately derived in China (CN-NAM) and the US (US-NAM) to explore the maize genomic features. The two populations containing 36 families and about 7000 recombinant inbred lines were evaluated with genotyping-by-sequencing. Through the comparison between the two NAMs, we revealed that segregation distortion is little, whereas epistasis for fitness is present in the two maize NAM populations. When conducting quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping for the total number of recombination events, we detected 14 QTLs controlling recombination. Using high-density markers to identify segregation distortion regions (SDRs), a total of 445 SDRs were detected within the 36 families, among which 15 common SDRs were found in at least ten families. About 80 \% of the known maize gametophytic factors (ga) genes controlling segregation distortion were overlapped with highly significant SDRs. In addition, we also found that the regions with high recombination rate and high gene density usually tended to have little segregation distortion. This study will facilitate population genetic studies and gene cloning affecting recombination variation and segregation distortion in maize, which can improve plant breeding progress.},

  abstract = {Segregation distortion can negatively impact on gains expected using selection. In order to increase our understanding of genetic factors that may influence the extent and direction of segregation distortion, segregation distortion analyses were conducted in four different doubled haploid (DH) populations. A high-density composite map of barley was then constructed by integrating information from the four populations. The composite map contained 2,111 unique loci, comprising RFLP, SSR and DArT markers and spanned 1,136 cM. In the four populations investigated, the proportion of markers with segregation distortion ranged from 15 to 38\%, depending on the population. The highest distortion was observed in populations derived by the microspore culture technique. Distorted loci tended to be clustered, which allowed definition of segregation distortion regions (SDRs). A total of 14 SDRs were identified in the 4 populations. Using the high-density composite map, several SDRs were shown to have consistent map locations in two or more populations; one SDR on chromosome 1H was present in all four populations. The analysis of haplotypes underlying seven SDRs indicated that in three cases the under-represented haplotypes were common across populations, but for four SDRs the under-represented haplotypes varied across populations. Six of the seven centromeric regions harboured SDRs suggesting that genetic processes related to position near a centromere caused the segregation distortion in these SDRs. Other SDRs were most likely due to the methods used to produce the DH populations. The association of the SDRs identified in this study and some of the genes involved in the process of haploid production described in other studies were compared. The composite map constructed in this study provides an additional resource for the barley community via increased genome coverage and the provision of additional marker options. It has also enabled further insights into mechanisms that underpin segregation distortion.},

Despite the availability of many genomic resources in pear, it is challenging to genotype novel germplasm resources and breeding progeny in a timely and cost-effective manner. Genotyping arrays can provide fast, efficient and high-throughput genetic characterization of diverse germplasm, genetic mapping and breeding populations. We present here 200K AXIOM\textregistered{} PyrSNP, a large-scale single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping array to facilitate genotyping of Pyrus species. A diverse panel of 113 re-sequenced pear genotypes was used to discover SNPs to promote increased adoption of the array. A set of 188 diverse accessions and an F1 population of 98 individuals from `Cuiguan' \texttimes{} `Starkrimson' was genotyped with the array to assess its effectiveness. A large majority of SNPs (166 335 or 83\%) are of high quality. The high density and uniform distribution of the array SNPs facilitated prediction of centromeric regions on 17 pear chromosomes, and significantly improved the genome assembly from 75.5\% to 81.4\% based on genetic mapping. Identification of a gene associated with flowering time and candidate genes linked to size of fruit core via genome wide association studies showed the usefulness of the array in pear genetic research. The newly developed high-density SNP array presents an important tool for rapid and high-throughput genotyping in pear for genetic map construction, QTL identification and genomic selection.},

We constructed spatial proximity maps of the human genome with Hi-C at a resolution of 1 megabase. These maps confirm the presence of chromosome territories and the spatial proximity of small, gene-rich chromosomes. We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes. Chromosomes are organized in a fractal knot-free conformation that is densely packed while easily folded and unfolded.

  abstract = {Summary We examined the effects of substrate divergence and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) on recombination in Arabidopsis thaliana. Relative to the frequency observed in plants with a homologous construct (0\% divergence), recombination was decreased 4.1?, 9.6?, 11.7? or 20.3?fold, respectively, in lines with constructs containing 0.5\%, 2\%, 4\% or 9\% divergence between the recombination substrates. To evaluate the contribution of the MMR system in this decrease, 12 independent reporter lines (two or three lines per reporter construct) were crossed to an AtMSH2 T?DNA insertional mutant. We examined the recombination frequency in progeny homozygous for a reporter T?DNA and homozygous either for the wild type or the mutant allele of AtMSH2. The loss of MMR activity led to a two? to ninefold increase in homeologous recombination and the size of the increase did not seem to correlate with the amount of divergence. Inversely, complementation of the insertional mutant with a wild?type cDNA of AtMSH2 reduced recombination. Our results demonstrate clearly that sequence divergence can dramatically reduce the recombination frequency in plants and that the MMR system plays a part in this decrease.},

The non?coding nature of the recombination substrate has allowed us to monitor recombination events between duplicated copies of the intron that are either identical (homologous recombination) or harbour sequence polymorphisms (homoeologous recombination). The effects of substrate length and divergence on the frequency of recombination events were examined. A positive correlation between substrate length and somatic recombination frequency was found as the frequency of recombination increased 183?fold when the recombination substrate was lengthened from 153 to 589?bp. The existence of 11 polymorphisms in a 589?bp recombination substrate (1.9\% sequence divergence) led to an almost 10?fold reduction in the frequency of recombination. This result demonstrates that relatively modest levels of sequence divergence can substantially reduce the frequency of recombination in plants. A molecular analysis of recombination products revealed that the recombination junctions are more frequent in the central segment of the recombination substrate.},

The model overcomes limitations of existing approaches to understanding, summarizing, and interpreting LD by (i) relating patterns of LD directly to the underlying recombination process; (ii) considering all loci simultaneously, rather than pairwise; (iii) avoiding the assumption that LD necessarily has a ``block-like'' structure; and (iv) being computationally tractable for huge genomic regions (up to complete chromosomes). We examine in detail one natural application of the model: estimation of underlying recombination rates from population data. Using simulation, we show that in the case where recombination is assumed constant across the region of interest, recombination rate estimates based on our model are competitive with the very best of current available methods. More importantly, we demonstrate, on real and simulated data, the potential of the model to help identify and quantify fine-scale variation in recombination rate from population data. We also outline how the model could be useful in other contexts, such as in the development of more efficient haplotype-based methods for LD mapping.},

  abstract = {Meiotic drivers are genetic variants that selfishly manipulate the production of gametes to increase their own rate of transmission, often to the detriment of the rest of the genome and the individual that carries them. This genomic conflict potentially occurs whenever a diploid organism produces a haploid stage, and can have profound evolutionary impacts on gametogenesis, fertility, individual behaviour, mating system, population survival, and reproductive isolation. Multiple research teams are developing artificial drive systems for pest control, utilising the transmission advantage of drive to alter or exterminate target species. Here, we review current knowledge of how natural drive systems function, how drivers spread through natural populations, and the factors that limit their invasion.},

Rhoeo was chosen for this study for its unusual meiotic chromosome configurations (rings and chains) at diakinesis and the first metaphase which permitted the calculation of terminal-chiasma frequency, and for its genetic homogeneity among plants in a clone. Plants treated for 12 h and 24 h at 37\textdegree C had similar mean terminal-chiasma frequencies to that of controls (10.93{$\pm$}0.11, 10.95{$\pm$}0.09 and 10.64{$\pm$}0.07 respectively), while those treated for 36 h, 48 h or 60 h had lower mean terminal-chiasma frequencies than that of controls (8.06{$\pm$}0.18, 4.25{$\pm$}0.15, 0.76{$\pm$}0.07 and 10.64{$\pm$}0.07 respectively). Analysis of variance was performed to find out whether the mean terminal-chiasma frequencies resulted from different treatments were significantly different from one another.

  abstract = {The identification of orthologous groups is useful for genome annotation, studies on gene/protein evolution, comparative genomics, and the identification of taxonomically restricted sequences. Methods successfully exploited for prokaryotic genome analysis have proved difficult to apply to eukaryotes, however, as larger genomes may contain multiple paralogous genes, and sequence information is often incomplete. OrthoMCL provides a scalable method for constructing orthologous groups across multiple eukaryotic taxa, using a Markov Cluster algorithm to group (putative) orthologs and paralogs. This method performs similarly to the INPARANOID algorithm when applied to two genomes, but can be extended to cluster orthologs from multiple species. OrthoMCL clusters are coherent with groups identified by EGO, but improved recognition of ``recent'' paralogs permits overlapping EGO groups representing the same gene to be merged. Comparison with previously assigned EC annotations suggests a high degree of reliability, implying utility for automated eukaryotic genome annotation. OrthoMCL has been applied to the proteome data set from seven publicly available genomes (human, fly, worm, yeast, Arabidopsis, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and Escherichia coli). A Web interface allows queries based on individual genes or user-defined phylogenetic patterns (http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/gene-family). Analysis of clusters incorporating P. falciparum genes identifies numerous enzymes that were incompletely annotated in first-pass annotation of the parasite genome.},

By sequencing flow-sorted 3B chromosome from a hexaploid wheat genotype CRNIL1A and comparing the obtained sequences with those available for CS, we detected that a large number of sequences in the former were missing in the latter. If the distribution of such sequences in the hexaploid wheat genome is random, CRNILA sequences missing in CS could be as much as 159.3 Mb even if only fragments of 50 bp or longer were considered. Analysing RNA sequences available in the public domains also revealed that dispensable genes are common in hexaploid wheat. Together with those extensive intra- and interchromosomal rearrangements in CS, the existence of such dispensable genes is another factor highlighting potential issues with the use of reference genomes in various studies. Strong deviation in distributions of these dispensable sequences among genotypes with different geographical origins provided the first evidence indicating that they could be associated with adaptation in wheat.},

  abstract = {Miscanthus is a perennial C4 grass that has recently become an important bioenergy crop. The efficiency of breeding improved Miscanthus biomass cultivars could be greatly increased by marker-assisted selection. Thus, a high-density genetic map is critical to Miscanthus improvement. In this study, a mapping population of 261 F1 progeny was developed from a cross between two diploid M. sinensis cultivars, `Strictus' and `Kaskade'. High-density genetic maps for the two parents were produced with 3044 newly developed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from restriction site-associated DNA sequencing, and 138 previously mapped GoldenGate SNPs. The female parent (`Strictus') map spanned 1599 cM, with 1989 SNPs on 19 linkage groups, and an average intermarker spacing of 0.8 cM. The length of the male parent (`Kaskade') map was 1612 cM, with 1821 SNPs, and an average intermarker spacing of 0.9 cM. The utility of the map was confirmed by locating quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the zebra-striped trait, which was segregating in this population. Three QTL for zebra-striped presence/absence (zb1, zb2 on LG 7, and zb3 on LG 10) and three for zebra-striped intensity (zbi1, zbi2, zbi3 on LGs 7, 10, 3) were identified. Each allele that caused striping was recessive. Incomplete penetrance was observed for each zb QTL, but penetrance was greatest when two or more zb QTL were homozygous for the causative alleles. Similarly, the intensity of striping was greatest when two or more zbi QTL were homozygous for alleles that conferred the trait. Comparative mapping indicated putative correspondence between zb3 and/or zbi2 on LG 10 to previously sequenced genes conferring zebra stripe in maize and rice. These results demonstrate that the new map is useful for identifying marker\textendash trait associations. The mapped markers will become a valuable community resource, facilitating comparisons among studies and the breeding of Miscanthus.},

Durum wheat miRNAs may contribute to the genotypic water-deficit stress response in different durum varieties. Further investigation of the interactive miRNA-target regulatory modules and experimental validation of their response to water stress will contribute to our understanding of the small RNA-mediated molecular networks underlying stress adaptation in durum wheat. In this study, a comprehensive genome-wide in silico analysis using the updated Triticum transcriptome assembly identified 2055 putative targets for 113 conserved durum miRNAs and 131 targets for four novel durum miRNAs that putatively contribute to genotypic stress tolerance. Predicted mRNA targets encode various transcription factors, binding proteins and functional enzymes, which play vital roles in multiple biological pathways such as hormone signalling and metabolic processes. Quantitative PCR profiling further characterised 43 targets and 5 miRNAs with stress-responsive and/or genotype-dependent differential expression in two stress-tolerant and two stress-sensitive durum genotypes subjected to pre-anthesis water-deficit stress. Furthermore, a 5{${'}$} RLM-RACE approach validated nine mRNA targets cleaved by water-deficit stress-responsive miRNAs, which, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported in durum wheat. The present study provided experimental evidence of durum miRNAs and target genes in response to water-deficit stress in contrasting durum varieties, providing new insights into the regulatory roles of the miRNA-guided RNAi mechanism underlying stress adaptation in durum wheat.},

A 1.1-Mb region showing the highest number of positive bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones was fully sequenced and annotated, revealing that 96\% of the DNA consisted of transposable elements, mainly long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons (88\%). Estimation of the insertion time of the transposable elements revealed that CRW (also called Cereba) and Quinta are the youngest elements at the centromeres of common wheat (Triticum~spp.) and its diploid ancestors, with Quinta being younger than CRW in both diploid and hexaploid wheats. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that both CRW and Quinta families are targeted by the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENH3. Immuno colocalization of retroelements and CENH3 antibody indicated that a higher proportion of Quinta than CRWs was associated with CENH3, although CRWs were more abundant. Long arrays of satellite repeats were also identified in the wheat centromere regions, but they lost the ability to bind with CENH3. In addition to transposons, two functional genes and one pseudogene were identified. The gene density in the centromere appeared to be between three and four times lower than the average gene density of chromosome~3B. Comparisons with related grasses also indicated a loss of microcollinearity in this region. Finally, comparison of centromeric sequences of Aegilops tauschii (DD), Triticum boeoticum (AA) and hexaploid wheat revealed that the centromeres in both the polyploids and diploids are still undergoing dynamic changes, and that the new CRWs and Quintas may have undertaken the core role in kinetochore formation.},

  abstract = {Synaptonemal complex (SC) formation in microsporocytes of Allium ursinum is severely affected by exposure of plants to 35\textdegree{} C for 30 h or longer. In spread preparations made from fresh and freeze-conserved material it was found that a high proportion of meiocytes is arrested at leptotene and shows no synapsis at all. In another group of nuclei synaptonemal polycomplex-like structures do occur between converging axial elements at presumed rudimentary SC initiation sites. Axial elements are virtually always thickened at these sites which seem to involve primarily heterologous chromosomes. A third situation is seen in nuclei where two or more lateral elements are engaged in the formation of longer stretches of aberrant SCs. These feature surplus material filling the central space. It may be assumed that this abnormal condition precludes crossing over and hence may be one of several ways by which elevated temperatures cause the chiasma reduction described here for A. ursinum and reported for several other organisms in the literature.},

  abstract = {In the biological sciences there have been technological advances that catapult the discipline into golden ages of discovery. For example, the field of microbiology was transformed with the advent of Anton van Leeuwenhoek's microscope, which allowed scientists to visualize prokaryotes for the first time. The development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one of those innovations that changed the course of molecular science with its impact spanning countless subdisciplines in biology. The theoretical process was outlined by Keppe and coworkers in 1971; however, it was another 14 years until the complete PCR procedure was described and experimentally applied by Kary Mullis while at Cetus Corporation in 1985. Automation and refinement of this technique progressed with the introduction of a thermal stable DNA polymerase from the bacterium Thermus aquaticus, consequently the name Taq DNA polymerase., PCR is a powerful amplification technique that can generate an ample supply of a specific segment of DNA (i.e., an amplicon) from only a small amount of starting material (i.e., DNA template or target sequence). While straightforward and generally trouble-free, there are pitfalls that complicate the reaction producing spurious results. When PCR fails it can lead to many non-specific DNA products of varying sizes that appear as a ladder or smear of bands on agarose gels. Sometimes no products form at all. Another potential problem occurs when mutations are unintentionally introduced in the amplicons, resulting in a heterogeneous population of PCR products. PCR failures can become frustrating unless patience and careful troubleshooting are employed to sort out and solve the problem(s). This protocol outlines the basic principles of PCR, provides a methodology that will result in amplification of most target sequences, and presents strategies for optimizing a reaction. By following this PCR guide, students should be able to: \ding{108} Set up reactions and thermal cycling conditions for a conventional PCR experiment \ding{108} Understand the function of various reaction components and their overall effect on a PCR experiment \ding{108} Design and optimize a PCR experiment for any DNA template \ding{108} Troubleshoot failed PCR experiments},

Therefore, specific likelihood equations have to be developed for each case, including dominant and codominant markers. The asymptotic bias of the ``classical'' estimates are derived for each case, in order to compare them with the standard errors of the suggested estimates. We discuss the utility and the efficiency of a previous model developed for dominant markers. We show that dominant markers provide very poor information in the case of segregation distortion and, therefore, should be used with circumspection. On the other hand, the estimation of recombination fractions between codominant markers is less affected by selection than is that for dominant markers. We also discuss the analysis of linkage between dominant and codominant markers.},

This was thought to be a consequence of terminal initiation of synapsis favoring distal crossing over. However, in an inverted rye chromosome arm, the pattern of metaphase I chiasmata was also inverted, suggesting that crossover frequencies were specific to chromosome segments. Here, wheat chromosome arms 2BS and 4AL, with essentially entire arms inverted in reverse tandem duplications (rtd), were studied in the MI of meiosis. Inversion\textendash duplication placed the recombining segments in the middle of the arms. While the overall pairing frequencies of the inverted\textendash duplicated arms were considerably reduced relative to normal arms, chiasmata, if present, were always located in the same regions as in structurally normal arms, and relative chiasma frequencies remained the same. The frequencies of fragment or fragment + bridge configurations in AI and AII indicated that of the two tandemly arranged copies of segments in rtds, the more distal inverted segments were more likely to cross over than the segments in their original orientations. These observations show that also in wheat, relative crossover frequencies along chromosome arms are predetermined and independent of the segment location. The segments normally not licensed to cross over do not do so even when placed in seemingly most favorable positions for it.},

To study the physical distribution of recombination, polymorphism for C-banding patterns was used to monitor recombination in 67 segments in 11 B-genome chromosome arms of Triticum turgidum. Recombination was absent in proximal regions of all chromosome arms; its frequency increased exponentially with distance from the centromere. A significant difference was observed between the distribution of recombination in physically short and physically long arms. In physically short arms, recombination was almost exclusively concentrated in distal segments and only those regions were represented in their genetic maps. In physically long arms, while a majority of the genetic distance was again based upon recombination in distal chromosome segments, some interstitial recombination was observed. Consequently, these regions also contributed to the genetic maps. Such a pattern of recombination, skewed toward terminal segments of chromosomes, is probably a result of telomeric pairing initiation and strong positive chiasma interference. Interference averaged 0.81 in 35 pairs of adjacent segments and 0.57 across the entire recombining portions of chromosome arms. The total genetic map lengths of the arms corresponded closely to those expected on the basis of their metaphase-I chiasma frequencies. As a consequence of this uneven distribution of recombination there can be a 153-fold difference (or more) in the number of DNA base pairs per unit (centiMorgan) of genetic length.},

Observations of meiotic behavior of a rye chromosome with an inverted arm show that patterns of chiasma distribution and frequency are also inverted; therefore, the patterns of synapsis and chiasma distribution are independent, and recombination frequency along a chromosome is position-independent and segment-specific. Since cases of random distribution of chiasmata and recombination are known in rye, a genetic mechanism must be present that licenses specific chromosome regions for recombination. Large differences in the metaphase I pairing of the inversion in various combinations of two armed and telocentric chromosomes confirm the major role of the telomere bouquet in early homologue recognition. However, occasional synapsis and chiasmate pairing of the distal regions of normal arms with the proximal regions of the inversion suggest that an alternative mechanism for juxtaposing of homologues must also be present. Synapsis in inversion heterozygotes was mostly complete but in the antiparallel orientation, hence defying homology, but non-homologues never synapsed. Instances of synapsis strictly limited to the chiasma-capable segments of the arm suggest that, in rye, both recombination-dependent and recombination-independent mechanisms for homologue recognition must be present.},

The large size and highly repetitive nature of the Ae. tauschii genome has until now precluded the development of a reference-quality genome sequence5. Here we use an array of advanced technologies, including ordered-clone genome sequencing, whole-genome shotgun sequencing, and BioNano optical genome mapping, to generate a reference-quality genome sequence for Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata accession AL8/78, which is closely related to the wheat D genome. We show that compared to other sequenced plant genomes, including a much larger conifer genome, the Ae. tauschii genome contains unprecedented amounts of very similar repeated sequences. Our genome comparisons reveal that the Ae. tauschii genome has a greater number of dispersed duplicated genes than other sequenced genomes and its chromosomes have been structurally evolving an order of magnitude faster than those of other grass genomes. The decay of colinearity with other grass genomes correlates with recombination rates along chromosomes. We propose that the vast amounts of very similar repeated sequences cause frequent errors in recombination and lead to gene duplications and structural chromosome changes that drive fast genome evolution.},

  abstract = {The natural history of adult worker honey bees (Apis mellifera) provides an opportunity to study the molecular basis of learning in an ecological context. Foragers must learn to navigate between the hive and floral locations that may be up to miles away. Young pre-foragers prepare for this task by performing orientation flights near the hive, during which they begin to learn navigational cues such as the appearance of the hive, the position of landmarks, and the movement of the sun. Despite well-described spatial learning and navigation behavior, there is currently limited information on the neural basis of insect spatial learning. We found that Egr, an insect homolog of Egr-1, is rapidly and transiently upregulated in the mushroom bodies in response to orientation. This result is the first example of an Egr-1 homolog acting as a learning-related immediate-early gene in an insect and also demonstrates that honey bee orientation uses a molecular mechanism that is known to be involved in many other forms of learning. This transcriptional response occurred both in na\"ive bees and in foragers induced to re-orient. Further experiments suggest that visual environmental novelty, rather than exercise or memorization of specific visual cues, acts as the stimulus for Egr upregulation. Our results implicate the mushroom bodies in spatial learning and emphasize the deep conservation of Egr-related pathways in experience-dependent plasticity.},

Since its first release, pcadapt has evolved in terms of both statistical approach and software implementation. We present results obtained with robust Mahalanobis distance, which is a new statistic for genome scans available in the 2.0 and later versions of the package. When hierarchical population structure occurs, Mahalanobis distance is more powerful than the communality statistic that was implemented in the first version of the package. Using simulated data, we compare pcadapt to other computer programs for genome scans (BayeScan, hapflk, OutFLANK, sNMF). We find that the proportion of false discoveries is around a nominal false discovery rate set at 10\% with the exception of BayeScan that generates 40\% of false discoveries. We also find that the power of BayeScan is severely impacted by the presence of admixed individuals whereas pcadapt is not impacted. Last, we find that pcadapt and hapflk are the most powerful in scenarios of population divergence and range expansion. Because pcadapt handles next-generation sequencing data, it is a valuable tool for data analysis in molecular ecology.},

  abstract = {Birds parasitized by interspecific brood parasites often adopt defences based on egg recognition but such behaviours are puzzlingly rare in species parasitized by members of the same species. Here I show that conspecific egg recognition is frequent, accurate and used in three defences that reduce the high costs of conspecific brood parasitism in American coots. Hosts recognized and rejected many parasitic eggs, reducing the fitness costs of parasitism by half. Recognition without rejection also occurred and some hosts banished parasitic eggs to inferior outer incubation positions. Clutch size comparisons revealed that females combine egg recognition and counting to make clutch size decisions\textendash by counting their own eggs, while ignoring distinctive parasitic eggs, females avoid a maladaptive clutch size reduction. This is clear evidence that female birds use visual rather than tactile cues to regulate their clutch sizes, and provides a rare example of the ecological and evolutionary context of counting in animals.},

Nevertheless, there is a small, but important, group of genetic systems that subvert the law of segregation, and show `meiotic drive'.},

The next set of chapters looks at agronomy and cropping practices in a wide range of wheat growing regions across the world. The third set of chapters records the latest advances in wheat breeding, looking at concepts and strategies as well as current and developing techniques. The fourth set reviews the developing end uses. The final group of chapters examines specific biotic and abiotic threats from viruses, insect pests and diseases.This book is subtitled A History of Wheat Breeding. It would be even more accurate to say that it records and discusses the continuing history of wheat breeding. As stated by Pierre Pagesse, Chairman of Groupe Limagrain, in his Preface: "The future of wheat rests in our hands and in those who succeed us. Let us try to do this together in a visionary and determined manner".},

  abstract = {Like other hydrozoan medusae, Aglantha lacks a brain, but the two marginal nerve rings function together as a central nervous system. Twelve neuronal and two excitable epithelial conduction systems are described and their interactions summarized. Aglantha differs from most medusae in having giant axons. It can swim and contract its tentacles in two distinct ways (escape and slow). Escape responses are mediated primarily by giant axons but conventional interneurons are also involved in transmission of information within the nerve rings during one form of escape behavior. Surprisingly, giant axons provide the motor pathway to the swim muscles in both escape and slow swimming. This is possible because these axons can conduct calcium spikes as well as sodium spikes and do so on an either/or basis without overlap. The synaptic and ionic bases for these responses are reviewed. During feeding, the manubrium performs highly accurate flexions to points at the margin. At the same time, the oral lips flare open. The directional flexions are conducted by FMRFamide immunoreactive nerves, the lip flaring by an excitable epithelium lining the radial canals. Inhibition of swimming during feeding is due to impulses propagated centrifugally in the same epithelium. Aglantha probably evolved from an ancestor possessing a relatively simple wiring plan, as seen in other hydromedusae. Acquisition of giant axons resulted in considerable modification of this basic plan, and required novel solutions to the problems of integrating escape with non-escape circuitry.},

In general, each population had unique segregation distortion regions and directions of distortion. Interspecific crosses showed greater levels of distorted segregation and lower recombination rates as determined from the male parents. The different genomic regions where the segregation distortion regions occurred in the three populations likely reflect unique genetic combinations producing distorted segregation.},

One technology in the frame is that produced by 454 Life Sciences Corporation of Branford, Connecticut. Today's technology reads 67,000 base pairs per hour; this new approach is 100 times faster, reading 6 million base pairs per hour. The improved performance results from using picolitre-sized chemical reactors, enhanced light-emitting sequencing chemistries and complex informatics. Further miniaturization of the system is planned. Such leaps in technology may one day make it possible to analyse an individual's genome before designing therapy: the ultimate in personalized medicine.},

  abstract = {Two widely held assumptions about the sounds of birds and other animals are (1) they are impulsive and involuntary, and cannot be controlled, and (2) they are based only on emotion, apparently because the stimuli eliciting them are thought to be very generalized. The validity of these assumptions has been tested in studies of the alarm calling and food calling behavior of domestic chickens. Videotapes of aerial and ground predators-a hawk overhead and a raccoon on the ground-were effective in eliciting the two major classes of alarm calls. The frequency of aerial alarm calling was strongly affected by presence or absence of a companion, while other aspects of antipredator behavior were unchanged. This so-called ''audience effect'' on calling is not found with the ground predator call, apparently because this call is addressed to the predator as well as companions. The rules for audience effects are different again with food calling. Evidently calling is not completely impulsive, but can be controlled. By varying the attributes of digitized video images of predators we have shown that stimuli eliciting the aerial predator alarm call are quite specific, encoding different information than the ground predator call. Playback experiments demonstrate that another chicken can decode this information, and react adaptively. Although emotion is undoubtedly involved in bird calling, we conclude that simple emotion-based models of bird calls are inadequate as the sole basis for explaining the vocal behavior of birds.},

  abstract = {A durum wheat consensus linkage map was developed by combining segregation data from six mapping populations. All of the crosses were derived from durum wheat cultivars, except for one accession of T. ssp. dicoccoides. The consensus map was composed of 1,898 loci arranged into 27 linkage groups covering all 14 chromosomes. The length of the integrated map and the average marker distance were 3,058.6 and 1.6 cM, respectively. The order of the loci was generally in agreement with respect to the individual maps and with previously published maps. When the consensus map was aligned to the deletion bin map, 493 markers were assigned to specific bins. Segregation distortion was found across many durum wheat chromosomes, with a higher frequency for the B genome. This high-density consensus map allowed the scanning of the genome for chromosomal rearrangements occurring during the wheat evolution. Translocations and inversions that were already known in literature were confirmed, and new putative rearrangements are proposed. The consensus map herein described provides a more complete coverage of the durum wheat genome compared with previously developed maps. It also represents a step forward in durum wheat genomics and an essential tool for further research and studies on evolution of the wheat genome.},

  abstract = {All life is organized as cells. Physical compartmentation from the environment and self-organization of self-contained redox reactions are the most conserved attributes of living things, hence inorganic matter with such attributes would be life's most likely forebear. We propose that life evolved in structured iron monosulphide precipitates in a seepage site hydrothermal mound at a redox, pH and temperature gradient between sulphide-rich hydrothermal fluid and iron(II)-containing waters of the Hadean ocean floor. The naturally arising, three-dimensional compartmentation observed within fossilized seepage-site metal sulphide precipitates indicates that these inorganic compartments were the precursors of cell walls and membranes found in free-living prokaryotes. The known capability of FeS and NiS to catalyse the synthesis of the acetyl-methylsulphide from carbon monoxide and methylsulphide, constituents of hydrothermal fluid, indicates that pre-biotic syntheses occurred at the inner surfaces of these metal-sulphide-walled compartments, which furthermore restrained reacted products from diffusion into the ocean, providing sufficient concentrations of reactants to forge the transition from geochemistry to biochemistry. The chemistry of what is known as the RNA-world could have taken place within these naturally forming, catalyticwalled compartments to give rise to replicating systems. Sufficient concentrations of precursors to support replication would have been synthesized in situ geochemically and biogeochemically, with FeS (and NiS) centres playing the central catalytic role. The universal ancestor we infer was not a free-living cell, but rather was confined to the naturally chemiosmotic, FeS compartments within which the synthesis of its constituents occurred. The first free-living cells are suggested to have been eubacterial and archaebacterial chemoautotrophs that emerged more than 3.8 Gyr ago from their inorganic confines. We propose that the emergence of these prokaryotic lineages from inorganic confines occurred independently, facilitated by the independent origins of membrane-lipid biosynthesis: isoprenoid ether membranes in the archaebacterial and fatty acid ester membranes in the eubacterial lineage. The eukaryotes, all of which are ancestrally heterotrophs and possess eubacterial lipids, are suggested to have arisen ca. 2 Gyr ago through symbiosis involving an autotrophic archaebacterial host and a heterotrophic eubacterial symbiont, the common ancestor of mitochondria and hydrogenosomes. The attributes shared by all prokaryotes are viewed as inheritances from their confined universal ancestor. The attributes that distinguish eubacteria and archaebacteria, yet are uniform within the groups, are viewed as relics of their phase of differentiation after divergence from the non-free-living universal ancestor and before the origin of the free-living chemoautotrophic lifestyle. The attributes shared by eukaryotes with eubacteria and archaebacteria, respectively, are viewed as inheritances via symbiosis. The attributes unique to eukaryotes are viewed as inventions specific to their lineage. The origin of the eukaryotic endomembrane system and nuclear membrane are suggested to be the fortuitous result of the expression of genes for eubacterial membrane lipid synthesis by an archaebacterial genetic apparatus in a compartment that was not fully prepared to accommodate such compounds, resulting in vesicles of eubacterial lipids that accumulated in the cytosol around their site of synthesis. Under these premises, the most ancient divide in the living world is that between eubacteria and archaebacteria, yet the steepest evolutionary grade is that between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.},

Their large genomes are characterized by a high content of repetitive elements and large pericentromeric regions that are virtually devoid of meiotic recombination. Here we present a high-quality reference genome assembly for barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). We use chromosome conformation capture mapping to derive the linear order of sequences across the pericentromeric space and to investigate the spatial organization of chromatin in the nucleus at megabase resolution. The composition of genes and repetitive elements differs between distal and proximal regions. Gene family analyses reveal lineage-specific duplications of genes involved in the transport of nutrients to developing seeds and the mobilization of carbohydrates in grains. We demonstrate the importance of the barley reference sequence for breeding by inspecting the genomic partitioning of sequence variation in modern elite germplasm, highlighting regions vulnerable to genetic erosion.},

Recognition odours appear to vary linearly with relatedness, rather than in an all-or-none fashion, allowing precise estimates of kinship even among distant relatives. Thus S. beldingi are able to recognize their distant kin and male kin, even though they do not treat them preferentially. I also show that a closely related species (S. lateralis) similarly produces kin labels and discriminates among kin, although it shows no evidence of kin-directed behaviour. Thus, contrary to a commonly held assumption, kin favouritism and recognition abilities can evolve independently, depending on variation in the costs and benefits of nepotism for a given species.},

Various mating systems can be simulated, comprising planned crosses, random mating, partial selfing, selfing, single-seed descent, double haploids, topcrosses, and factorials. Selection can be simulated according to selection indices based on phenotypic values and/or molecular marker scores. Data analysis routines are provided to analyze simulated and experimental datasets for allele and genotype frequencies, genotypic and phenotypic values and variances, molecular genetic diversity, linkage disequilibrium, and parameters to optimize marker-assisted backcrossing programs. Plabsoft has already been employed in numerous studies, we chose some of them to illustrate the functionality of the software.},

Using a series of bioinformatically constructed genome zippers that integrate gene indices of rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and Brachypodium distachyon in a conserved synteny model, we were able to assemble 21,766 barley genes in a putative linear order. We show that the barley (H) genome displays a mosaic of structural similarity to hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) A, B, and D subgenomes and that orthologous genes in different grasses exhibit signatures of positive selection in different lineages. We present an ordered, information-rich scaffold of the barley genome that provides a valuable and robust framework for the development of novel strategies in cereal breeding.},

  abstract = {This article is devoted to the problem of ordering in linkage groups with many dozens or even hundreds of markers. The ordering problem belongs to the field of discrete optimization on a set of all possible orders, amounting to n!/2 for n loci; hence it is considered an NP-hard problem. Several authors attempted to employ the methods developed in the well-known traveling salesman problem (TSP) for multilocus ordering, using the assumption that for a set of linked loci the true order will be the one that minimizes the total length of the linkage group. A novel, fast, and reliable algorithm developed for the TSP and based on evolution-strategy discrete optimization was applied in this study for multilocus ordering on the basis of pairwise recombination frequencies. The quality of derived maps under various complications (dominant vs. codominant markers, marker misclassification, negative and positive interference, and missing data) was analyzed using simulated data with approximately 50-400 markers. High performance of the employed algorithm allows systematic treatment of the problem of verification of the obtained multilocus orders on the basis of computing-intensive bootstrap and/or jackknife approaches for detecting and removing questionable marker scores, thereby stabilizing the resulting maps. Parallel calculation technology can easily be adopted for further acceleration of the proposed algorithm. Real data analysis (on maize chromosome 1 with 230 markers) is provided to illustrate the proposed methodology.},

  abstract = {Our aim was to develop a fast and accurate algorithm for constructing consensus genetic maps for chip-based SNP genotyping data with a high proportion of shared markers between mapping populations. Chip-based genotyping of SNP markers allows producing high-density genetic maps with a relatively standardized set of marker loci for different mapping populations. The availability of a standard high-throughput mapping platform simplifies consensus analysis by ignoring unique markers at the stage of consensus mapping thereby reducing mathematical complicity of the problem and in turn analyzing bigger size mapping data using global optimization criteria instead of local ones. Our three-phase analytical scheme includes automatic selection of \textasciitilde 100-300 of the most informative (resolvable by recombination) markers per linkage group, building a stable skeletal marker order for each data set and its verification using jackknife re-sampling, and consensus mapping analysis based on global optimization criterion. A novel Evolution Strategy optimization algorithm with a global optimization criterion presented in this paper is able to generate high quality, ultra-dense consensus maps, with many thousands of markers per genome. This algorithm utilizes "potentially good orders" in the initial solution and in the new mutation procedures that generate trial solutions, enabling to obtain a consensus order in reasonable time. The developed algorithm, tested on a wide range of simulated data and real world data (Arabidopsis), outperformed two tested state-of-the-art algorithms by mapping accuracy and computation time.},

Two wild tetraploid taxa, Ae. cylindrica and Ae. geniculata, were also included. Additionally, we incorporated wild Einkorn wheat Triticum boeoticum and its domesticated form T. monococcum and two Hordeum spontaneum (wild barley) genotypes. Chloroplast genomes were used for overall sequence comparison, phylogenetic analysis and dating of divergence times. We estimate that barley diverged from rye and wheat approximately 8\textendash 9 million years ago (MYA). The genome donors of hexaploid wheat diverged between 2.1\textendash 2.9 MYA, while rye diverged from Triticum aestivum approximately 3\textendash 4 MYA, more recently than previously estimated. Interestingly, the A genome taxa T. boeoticum and T. urartu were estimated to have diverged approximately 570,000 years ago. As these two have a reproductive barrier, the divergence time estimate also provides an upper limit for the time required for the formation of a species boundary between the two. Furthermore, we conclusively show that the chloroplast genome of hexaploid wheat was contributed by the B genome donor and that this unknown species diverged from Ae. speltoides about 980,000 years ago. Additionally, sequence alignments identified a translocation of a chloroplast segment to the nuclear genome which is specific to the rye/wheat lineage. We propose the presented phylogeny and divergence time estimates as a reference framework for future studies on Triticeae.},

By crossing the 'Chinese Spring' wheat tetrasomic series with rye, 21 different hybrid genotypes were produced, each with a single different homologous pair of wheat chromosomes. These hybrids enable the effect on chromosome pairing to be assessed for an extra dose of each of the 21 chromosomes. Significant effects were observed with eight of the chromosomes. Chiasma frequencies for each of the 21 pairs of chromosomes were also studied and the differences between the chromosomes were reported. The correlation between chromosome pairing and chiasma formation and chiasma frequency differences between bivalents and genomes are discussed.},

  abstract = {Plant insect interactions are usually recognized as a scenario where herbivorous insects feed on a host plant. However, also the opposite situation is known, where plants feed on insects. Carnivorous pitcher plants of the genus Nepenthes as well as other pitcher plants obtain many nutrients from caught insect prey. Special features of the pitcher traps' surface are responsible for attraction and trapping insects. Once caught, the prey is digested in the fluid of the pitchers to release nutrients and make them available for the plant. Nutrients are taken up by special glands localized on the inner surface of the pitchers. These glands also secrete the hydrolyzing enzymes into the digestion fluid. Although this is known for more than 100 years, our knowledge of the pitcher fluid composition is still limited. Only in recent years some enzymes have been purified from the pitcher fluid and their corresponding genes could be identified. Among them, many pathogenesis-related proteins have been identified, most of which exhibiting hydrolytic activities. The role of these proteins as well as the role of secondary metabolites, which have been identified in the pitcher fluid, is discussed in general and in the context of further studies on carnivorous plants that might give answers to basic questions in plant biology. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Simulation experiments have exploited chemically reactive mononucleotides as monomers. Solutions of such monomers in the prebiotic environment were likely to be very dilute, but in experimental simulations of polymerization reactions dilute solutions of activated mononucleotides in the millimolar range hydrolyze extensively, and only trace amounts of dimers and trimers are formed. We report here that random medium-size RNA analogues with mixed sequences (5- to 17-mers with traces of longer products) can be synthesized in ice eutectic phases that are produced when dilute solutions of activated monomers and catalysts (Mg(II) and Pb(II)) are frozen and maintained at -18 degrees C for periods up to 38 days. Under these conditions, the monomers are concentrated as eutectics in an ice matrix. Hydrolysis of the activated mononucleotides was suppressed at low-temperature ranges, and polymerization was enhanced with yields up to 90\%. Analysis of the mixed oligomers established that incorporation of both purine and pyrimidine bases proceeded at comparable rates and yields. These results suggest that ice deposits on the early Earth could have facilitated the synthesis of short- and medium-size random sequence RNA analogues and thereby provided a microenvironment suitable for the formation of biopolymers or their precursors.},

  abstract = {Nepenthes is the largest genus of pitcher plants, with its centre of diversity in SE Asia. The plants grow in substrates that are deficient in N and offset this deficiency by trapping animal prey, primarily arthropods. Recent research has provided new insights into the function of the pitchers, particularly with regard to prey tapping and retention. Species examined to date use combinations of wettable peristomes, wax layers and viscoelastic fluid to trap and retain prey. In many respects, this has redefined our understanding of the functioning of Nepenthes pitchers. In addition, recent research has shown that several Nepenthes species target specific groups of prey animals, or are even evolving away from a strictly carnivorous mode of operation. Future research into nutrient sequestration strategies and mechanisms of prey attraction would no doubt further enhance our knowledge of the ecology of this remarkable genus.},

  abstract = {Nepenthes pitcher plant species differ in their prey capture strategies, prey capture rates, and pitcher longevity. In this study, it is investigated whether or not interspecific differences in nutrient sequestration strategy are reflected in the physiology and microstructure of the pitchers themselves. Using a non-invasive technique (MIFE), ion fluxes in pitchers of Nepenthes ampullaria Jack, Nepenthes bicalcarata Hook.f., and Nepenthes rafflesiana Jack were measured. Scanning electron microscopy was also used to characterize the distribution of glandular and other structures on the inner pitcher walls. The results demonstrate that nutrient sequestration strategy is indeed mirrored in pitcher physiology and microstructure. Species producing long-lived pitchers with low prey capture rates (N. ampullaria, N. bicalcarata) showed lower rates of NH(4)(+) uptake than N. rafflesiana, a species producing short-lived pitchers with high capture rates. Crucially, species dependent upon aquatic commensals (N. ampullaria, N. bicalcarata) actively manipulated H(+) fluxes to maintain less acid pitcher fluid than found in 'typical' species; in addition, these species lacked the lunate cells and epicuticular waxes characteristic of 'typical' insectivorous congeners. An unexpected finding was that ion fluxes occurred in the wax-covered, non-glandular zones in N. rafflesiana. The only candidates for active transport of aqueous ions in these zones appear to be the epidermal cells lying beneath the lunate cells, as these are the only sites not visibly coated with epicuticular waxes.},

  abstract = {Meiosis is unusual among cell divisions in shuffling genetic material by crossovers among homologous chromosomes and partitioning the genome into haploid gametes. Crossovers are critical for chromosome segregation in most eukaryotes, but are also an important factor in evolution, as they generate novel genetic combinations. The molecular mechanisms that underpin meiotic recombination and chromosome segregation are well conserved across kingdoms, but are also sensitive to perturbation by environment, especially temperature. Even subtle shifts in temperature can alter the number and placement of crossovers, while at greater extremes, structural failures can occur in the linear axis and synaptonemal complex structures which are essential for recombination and chromosome segregation. Understanding the effects of temperature on these processes is important for its implications in evolution and breeding, especially in the context of global warming. In this review, we first summarize the process of meiotic recombination and its reliance on axis and synaptonemal complex structures, and then discuss effects of temperature on these processes and structures. We hypothesize that some consistent effects of temperature on recombination and meiotic thermotolerance may commonly be two sides of the same coin, driven by effects of temperature on the folding or interaction of key meiotic proteins.

Here we present the draft genome of Pleurobrachia bachei, Pacific sea gooseberry, together with ten other ctenophore transcriptomes, and show that they are remarkably distinct from other animal genomes in their content of neurogenic, immune and developmental genes. Our integrative analyses place Ctenophora as the earliest lineage within Metazoa. This hypothesis is supported by comparative analysis of multiple gene families, including the apparent absence of HOX genes, canonical microRNA machinery, and reduced immune complement in ctenophores. Although two distinct nervous systems are well recognized in ctenophores, many bilaterian neuron-specific genes and genes of 'classical' neurotransmitter pathways either are absent or, if present, are not expressed in neurons. Our metabolomic and physiological data are consistent with the hypothesis that ctenophore neural systems, and possibly muscle specification, evolved independently from those in other animals.},

In this paper we review the results of cue-conflict experiments designed to determine the relative importance of the different compass mechanisms, and how directional information from these compass mechanisms is integrated. We focus on cue-conflict experiments in which the magnetic field was shifted in alignment relative to natural celestial cues. Consistent with the conclusions of earlier authors, our analyses suggest that during the premigratory season, celestial information is given the greatest salience and used to recalibrate the magnetic compass by both juvenile and adult birds. Sunset polarized light patterns from the region of the sky near the horizon appear to provide the calibration reference for the magnetic compass. In contrast, during migration, a majority of experiments suggest that birds rely on the magnetic field as the primary source of compass information and use it to calibrate celestial compass cues, i.e. the relative saliency of magnetic and celestial cues is reversed. An alternative possibility, however, is suggested by several experiments in which birds exposed to a cue conflict during migration appear to have recalibrated the magnetic compass, i.e. their response is similar to that of birds exposed to cue conflicts during the premigratory season. The general pattern to emerge from these analyses is that birds exposed to the cue conflict with a view of the entire sunset sky tended to recalibrate the magnetic compass, regardless of whether the cue conflict occurred during the premigratory or migratory period. In contrast, birds exposed to the cue conflict in orientation funnels and registration cages that restricted their view of the region of sky near the horizon (as was generally the case in experiments carried out during the migratory season) did not recalibrate the magnetic compass but, instead, used the magnetic compass to calibrate the other celestial compass systems. If access to critical celestial cues, rather than the timing of exposure to the cue conflict (i.e. premigratory vs migratory), determines whether recalibration of the magnetic compass occurs, this suggests that under natural conditions there may be a single calibration reference for all of the compass systems of migratory birds that is derived from sunset (and possibly also sunrise) polarized light cues from the region of sky near the horizon. In cue-conflict experiments carried out during the migratory season, there was also an interesting asymmetry in the birds' response to magnetic fields shifted clockwise and counterclockwise relative to celestial cues. We discuss two possible explanations for these differences: (1) lateral asymmetry in the role of the right and left eye in mediating light-dependent magnetic compass orientation and (2) interference from the spectral and intensity distribution of skylight at sunset with the response of the light-dependent magnetic compass.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims Understanding the direct consequences of polyploidization is necessary for assessing the evolutionary significance of this mode of speciation. Previous studies have not studied the degree of between-population variation that occurs due to these effects. Although it is assumed that the effects of the substances that create synthetic polyploids disappear in second-generation synthetic polyploids, this has not been tested.Methods The direct consequences of polyploidization were assessed and separated from the effects of subsequent evolution in Vicia cracca, a naturally occurring species with diploid and autotetraploid cytotypes. Synthetic tetraploids were created from diploids of four mixed-ploidy populations. Performance of natural diploids and tetraploids was compared with that of synthetic tetraploids. Diploid offspring of the synthetic tetraploid mothers were also included in the comparison. In this way, the effects of colchicine application in the maternal generation on offspring performance could be compared independently of the effects of polyploidization.Key Results The sizes of seeds and stomata were primarily affected by cytotype, while plant performance differed between natural and synthetic polyploids. Most performance traits were also determined by colchicine application to the mothers, and most of these results were largely population specific.Conclusions Because the consequences of colchicine application are still apparent in the second generation of the plants, at least the third-generation polyploids should be considered in future comparisons. The specificities of the colchicine-treated plants may also be caused by strong selection pressures during the creation of synthetic polyploids. This could be tested by comparing the initial sizes of plants that survived the colchicine treatments with those of plants that did not. High variation between populations also suggests that different polyploids follow different evolutionary trajectories, and this should be considered when studying the effects of polyploidization.},

Heme oxygenase catalyzes the oxygenation of heme to biliverdin, an activity that is necessary for phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis.

The implementation of this knowledge in breeding strategies might accelerate the progress in obtaining high-yielding cultivars. Abstract The achievements of the Green Revolution were based on a specific plant ideotype, determined by a single gene involved in gibberellin signaling or metabolism. Compared with the 1950s, an enormous increase in our knowledge about the biological basis of plant productivity has opened new avenues for novel breeding strategies. The large and complex genomes of diploid barley and hexaploid wheat represent a great challenge, but they also offer a large reservoir of genes that can be targeted for breeding. We summarize examples of productivity-related genes/mutants in wheat and barley, identified or characterized by means of modern biology. The genes are classified functionally into several groups, including the following: (1) transcription factors, regulating spike development, which mainly affect grain number; (2) genes involved in metabolism or signaling of growth regulators\textemdash cytokinins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroids\textemdash which control plant architecture and in consequence stem hardiness and grain yield; (3) genes determining cell division and proliferation mainly impacting grain size; (4) floral regulators influencing inflorescence architecture and in consequence seed number; and (5) genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism having an impact on plant architecture and grain yield. The implementation of selected genes in breeding programs is discussed, considering specific genotypes, agronomic and climate conditions, and taking into account that many of the genes are members of multigene families.},

SSR, NBS-LRR, and Ser/Thr receptor-like protein loci within the alien introgression co-segregated with Rma in an F4 population (Gregory \texttimes{} Tifguard) and were tightly linked and spanned 3.4 cM in an F5 population (NemaTAM \texttimes{} GP-NC-WS-14). By comparative mapping in the A-genome progenitor of peanut (A. duranensis), Rma was discovered to have been introduced on an interstitial alien chromosome segment spanning one-third to one-half of chromosome 9A. Numerous codominant DNA markers were identified for finer mapping of Rma, shortening the alien introgression harboring Rma by marker-assisted selection, and introducing novel root-knot nematode R-genes into peanut by targeting syntenic segments on chromosomes 9A and 9B in wild diploid donors.},

  abstract = {This study describes reconstruction of two highly unusual archaeal genomes by de novo metagenomic assembly of multiple, deeply sequenced libraries from surface waters of Lake Tyrrell (LT), a hypersaline lake in NW Victoria, Australia. Lineage-specific probes were designed using the assembled genomes to visualize these novel archaea, which were highly abundant in the 0.1\textendash 0.8 {$\mu$}m size fraction of lake water samples. Gene content and inferred metabolic capabilities were highly dissimilar to all previously identified hypersaline microbial species. Distinctive characteristics included unique amino acid composition, absence of Gvp gas vesicle proteins, atypical archaeal metabolic pathways and unusually small cell size (approximately 0.6 {$\mu$}m diameter). Multi-locus phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that these organisms belong to a new major euryarchaeal lineage, distantly related to halophilic archaea of class Halobacteria. Consistent with these findings, we propose creation of a new archaeal class, provisionally named `Nanohaloarchaea'. In addition to their high abundance in LT surface waters, we report the prevalence of Nanohaloarchaea in other hypersaline environments worldwide. The simultaneous discovery and genome sequencing of a novel yet ubiquitous lineage of uncultivated microorganisms demonstrates that even historically well-characterized environments can reveal unexpected diversity when analyzed by metagenomics, and advances our understanding of the ecology of hypersaline environments and the evolutionary history of the archaea.},

Here, we show that reproductive altruism (i.e., a sterile soma) in the multicellular green alga, Volvox carteri, evolved via the co-option of a life-history gene whose expression in the unicellular ancestor was conditioned on an environmental cue (as an adaptive strategy to enhance survival at an immediate cost to reproduction) through shifting its expression from a temporal (environmentally induced) into a spatial (developmental) context. The gene belongs to a diverged and structurally heterogeneous multigene family sharing a SAND-like domain (a DNA-binding module involved in gene transcription regulation). To our knowledge, this is the first example of a social gene specifically associated with reproductive altruism, whose origin can be traced back to a solitary ancestor. These findings complement recent proposals that the differentiation of sterile castes in social insects involved the co-option of regulatory networks that control sequential shifts between phases in the life cycle of solitary insects.},

Archaeological and botanical evidence agree well in locating the domestication of einkorn (Triticum monococcutn) and emmer (Triticum dicoccum) in the fertile crescent of the Near East at about 7500 years BC (uncalibrated). DNA characterisation offers excellent potential for narrowing the area of origin, and tracing the sprcad of crops to Europe. The origin of spelt (T.spelta) is more complex. Biological and archaeological evidence agree that spelt first results from the hybfidisation of a cultivated tetraploid wheat and Aegilops tauschii near the Caspian Sea or in Transcaucasia. However archaeobotanical evidence for spelt in this region or on its putative routes to Europe is still scanty and is based on doubtful identifications. The sudden appearance of spelt in Early Bronze Age central Europe may be the result of a local hybridisation of free-threshing hexaploid wheat ( T aestivum) and cmmer wheat. The time and place of the origins of European spelt await resolution.},

As a first step towards the isolation of this complex locus, we performed molecular mapping of the Lr20 and Pm1 genes in three F2 populations. In two populations, a cluster of 8 and 12 markers, respectively, cosegregated with the resistance genes. In a third population based on a cross between a susceptible lr20 mutant and a resistant cultivar, all clustered markers were monomorphic. However, in this population the recombination frequency proximal to the Lr20 gene was up to 60 times higher, indicating that the complete genetic linkage of the clustered markers is not due to a close physical linkage of the probes but is caused by suppressed recombination. This was supported by the analysis of Triticum monococcum BAC clones where no physical linkage between cosegregating probes was..., Le locus Lr20Sr15Pm1 conf\`ere de la r\'esistance \`a trois pathog\`enes fongiques (rouille brune, rouille noire, o\"idium) chez le bl\'e h\'exaplo\"ide.

  abstract = {Taking the PERVs out of pigs With the severe shortage of organs needed for transplants, xenotransplantation (transplantation of nonhuman organs to humans) offers an alternative source. Some pig organs have similar size and function to those of humans. The challenge is that the pig genome harbors porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) that can potentially pass to humans with possibly damaging consequences. Niu et al. generated pigs in which all copies of PERVs were inactivated by CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering (see the Perspective by Denner). Not only does this work provide insights into PERV activity, but it also opens the door to a safer source of organs and tissues for pig-to-human xenotransplantation. Science, this issue p. 1303; see also p. 1238 Xenotransplantation is a promising strategy to alleviate the shortage of organs for human transplantation. In addition to the concerns about pig-to-human immunological compatibility, the risk of cross-species transmission of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) has impeded the clinical application of this approach. We previously demonstrated the feasibility of inactivating PERV activity in an immortalized pig cell line. We now confirm that PERVs infect human cells, and we observe the horizontal transfer of PERVs among human cells. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we inactivated all of the PERVs in a porcine primary cell line and generated PERV-inactivated pigs via somatic cell nuclear transfer. Our study highlights the value of PERV inactivation to prevent cross-species viral transmission and demonstrates the successful production of PERV-inactivated animals to address the safety concern in clinical xenotransplantation. Cloned pigs can be reared that lack all porcine endogenous retroviruses. Cloned pigs can be reared that lack all porcine endogenous retroviruses.},

The ISB stromatolites grew in a shallow marine environment, as indicated by seawater-like rare-earth element plus yttrium trace element signatures of the metacarbonates, and by interlayered detrital sedimentary rocks with cross-lamination and storm-wave generated breccias. The ISB stromatolites predate by 220 Myr the previous most convincing and generally accepted multidisciplinary evidence for oldest life remains in the 3,480-Myr-old Dresser Formation of the Pilbara Craton, Australia. The presence of the ISB stromatolites demonstrates the establishment of shallow marine carbonate production with biotic CO2 sequestration by 3,700 million years ago (Ma), near the start of Earth's sedimentary record.

The original estimate is based on the evaluation of host specificity of guilds in beetle samples, and subsequent hierarchical ratio extrapolations. The growing number of studies including mass sampling of arthropods have provided several data sets suitable for obtaining an empirical basis of this estimate. The structure in this modified version is somewhat changed compared to the original estimate in order to make each hierarchical step more easily testable.

  abstract = {Background Bread wheat has a large complex genome that makes whole genome resequencing costly. Therefore, genome complexity reduction techniques such as sequence capture make re-sequencing cost effective. With a high-quality draft wheat genome now available it is possible to design capture probe sets and to use them to accurately genotype and anchor SNPs to the genome. Furthermore, in addition to genetic variation, epigenetic variation provides a source of natural variation contributing to changes in gene expression and phenotype that can be profiled at the base pair level using sequence capture coupled with bisulphite treatment. Here, we present a new 12 Mbp wheat capture probe set, that allows both the profiling of genotype and methylation from the same DNA sample. Furthermore, we present a method, based on Agilent SureSelect Methyl-Seq, that will use a single capture assay as a starting point to allow both DNA sequencing and methyl-seq. Results Our method uses a single capture assay that is sequentially split and used for both DNA sequencing and methyl-seq. The resultant genotype and epi-type data is highly comparable in terms of coverage and SNP/methylation site identification to that generated from separate captures for DNA sequencing and methyl-seq. Furthermore, by defining SNP frequencies in a diverse landrace from the Watkins collection we highlight the importance of having genotype data to prevent false positive methylation calls. Finally, we present the design of a new 12 Mbp wheat capture and demonstrate its successful application to re-sequence wheat. Conclusions We present a cost-effective method for performing both DNA sequencing and methyl-seq from a single capture reaction thus reducing reagent costs, sample preparation time and DNA requirements for these complementary analyses.

Social bees provide a good model for this and, whilst there are published descriptions of their behaviour on initial learning flights close to the colony, it is still unclear how bees find floral resources over hundreds of metres and how these flights become directed foraging trips. We investigated the spatial ecology of exploration by radar tracking bumblebees, and comparing the flight trajectories of bees with differing experience. The bees left the colony within a day or two of eclosion and flew in complex loops of ever-increasing size around the colony, exhibiting L\'evy-flight characteristics constituting an optimal searching strategy. This mathematical pattern can be used to predict how animals exploring individually might exploit a patchy landscape. The bees' groundspeed, maximum displacement from the nest and total distance travelled on a trip increased significantly with experience. More experienced bees flew direct paths, predominantly flying upwind on their outward trips although forage was available in all directions. The flights differed from those of na\"ive honeybees: they occurred at an earlier age, showed more complex looping, and resulted in earlier returns of pollen to the colony. In summary bumblebees learn to find home and food rapidly, though phases of orientation, learning and searching were not easily separable, suggesting some multi-tasking.},

  abstract = {Background Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is an extremely useful tool for molecular and evolutionary biology and there are several programs and algorithms available for this purpose. Although previous studies have compared the alignment accuracy of different MSA programs, their computational time and memory usage have not been systematically evaluated. Given the unprecedented amount of data produced by next generation deep sequencing platforms, and increasing demand for large-scale data analysis, it is imperative to optimize the application of software. Therefore, a balance between alignment accuracy and computational cost has become a critical indicator of the most suitable MSA program. We compared both accuracy and cost of nine popular MSA programs, namely CLUSTALW, CLUSTAL OMEGA, DIALIGN-TX, MAFFT, MUSCLE, POA, Probalign, Probcons and T-Coffee, against the benchmark alignment dataset BAliBASE and discuss the relevance of some implementations embedded in each program's algorithm. Accuracy of alignment was calculated with the two standard scoring functions provided by BAliBASE, the sum-of-pairs and total-column scores, and computational costs were determined by collecting peak memory usage and time of execution. Results Our results indicate that mostly the consistency-based programs Probcons, T-Coffee, Probalign and MAFFT outperformed the other programs in accuracy. Whenever sequences with large N/C terminal extensions were present in the BAliBASE suite, Probalign, MAFFT and also CLUSTAL OMEGA outperformed Probcons and T-Coffee. The drawback of these programs is that they are more memory-greedy and slower than POA, CLUSTALW, DIALIGN-TX, and MUSCLE. CLUSTALW and MUSCLE were the fastest programs, being CLUSTALW the least RAM memory demanding program. Conclusions Based on the results presented herein, all four programs Probcons, T-Coffee, Probalign and MAFFT are well recommended for better accuracy of multiple sequence alignments. T-Coffee and recent versions of MAFFT can deliver faster and reliable alignments, which are specially suited for larger datasets than those encountered in the BAliBASE suite, if multi-core computers are available. In fact, parallelization of alignments for multi-core computers should probably be addressed by more programs in a near future, which will certainly improve performance significantly.},

We have investigated the biochemical basis for this lack of function. When the hy1 and hy2 mutants were grown in white light on a medium containing biliverdin IX[alpha], a direct precursor to phytochromobilin, the phytochrome chromophore, the seedlings developed with a morphological phenotype indistinguishable from the light-grown wild-type control. Restoration of a light-grown phenotype in the hy1 mutant was also accomplished by using phycocyanobilin, a tetrapyrrole analog of phytochromobilin. Spectrophotometric and immunochemical analyses of the rescued hy1 and hy2 mutants demonstrated that they possessed wild-type levels of photochemically functional phytochrome that displayed light-induced conformational changes in the holoprotein indistinguishable from the wild type. Moreover, phytochrome A levels declined in vivo in response to white light in rescued hy1 and hy2 seedlings, indicative of biliverdin-dependent formation of photochemically functional phytochrome A that was then subject to normal selective turnover in the far-red-light-absorbing form. Combined, these data suggest that the hy1 and hy2 mutants are inhibited in chromophore biosynthesis at steps prior to the formation of biliverdin IX[alpha], thus potentially causing a global functional deficiency in all members of the phytochrome photoreceptor family.},

  abstract = {Nematode infections are subject to density-dependent effects on their establishment, survivorship and fecundity within a host. These effects act to regulate and stabilize the size of nematode populations. Understanding how these density-dependent effects occur is important to guide the development of control strategies against parasitic nematodes and the diseases that they cause. These density-dependent effects have been hypothesized to result from intraspecific competition between parasites for limited resources or from the action of host immune responses.

These effects act to regulate and stabilize the size of nematode populations. Understanding how these density-dependent effects occur is important to guide the development of control strategies against parasitic nematodes and the diseases that they cause.

(Bromeliaceae) as a model system. Ecological differentiation of cytotypes and the link of polyploidy with historical biogeographic processes such as dispersal events and range shift are assessed.Methods 4{${'}$},6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining of nuclei and flow cytometry were used to estimate the ploidy levels of 159 plants from 22 species sampled throughout the distribution range of the genus. Ecological differentiation among ploidy levels was tested by comparing the sets of climatic variables. Ancestral chromosome number reconstruction was carried out on the basis of a previously generated phylogeographic framework.Key Results This study represents the first assessment of intrageneric, intraspecific and partially intrapopulational cytotype diversity in a genus of the Bromeliaceae family. In Fosterella, the occurrence of polyploidy was limited to the phylogenetically isolated penduliflora and rusbyi groups. Cytotypes were found to be ecologically differentiated, showing that polyploids preferentially occupy colder habitats with high annual temperature variability (seasonality). The combined effects of biogeographic history and adaptive processes are presumed to have shaped the current cytotype distribution in the genus.Conclusions The results provide indirect evidence for both adaptive ecological and non-adaptive historical processes that jointly influenced the cytotype distribution in the predominantly Andean genus Fosterella (Bromeliaceae). The results also exemplify the role of polyploidy as an important driver of speciation in a topographically highly structured and thus climatically diverse landscape.},

A wide variety of molecular tools has been established to accelerate genetic and physical mapping for facilitating the efficient identification of molecular markers linked to genes and QTL of agronomic interest. Already, wheat breeders are benefiting from a wide range of techniques to follow the introgression of the most favorable alleles in elite material and develop improved varieties. Breeders soon will be able to take advantage of new technological developments based on Next Generation Sequencing. In this paper, we review the molecular toolbox available to wheat scientists and breeders for performing fundamental genomic studies and breeding. Special emphasis is given on the production and detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that should enable a step change in saturating the wheat genome for more efficient genetic studies and for the development of new selection methods. The perspectives offered by the access to an ordered full genome sequence for further marker development and enhanced precision breeding is also discussed. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of marker-assisted selection for supporting wheat improvement.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The introduction of the \emph{Reduced height} (\emph{Rht})\emph{-B1b} and \emph{Rht-D1b} semidwarfing genes led to impressive increases in wheat (\emph{Triticum aestivum}) yields during the Green Revolution. The reduction in stem elongation in varieties containing these alleles is caused by a limited response to the phytohormone gibberellin (GA), resulting in improved resistance to stem lodging and yield benefits through an increase in grain number. \emph{Rht-B1} and \emph{Rht-D1} encode DELLA proteins, which act to repress GA-responsive growth, and their mutant alleles \emph{Rht-B1b} and \emph{Rht-D1b} are thought to confer dwarfism by producing more active forms of these growth repressors. While no semidwarfing alleles of \emph{Rht-A1} have been identified, we show that this gene is expressed at comparable levels to the other homeologs and represents a potential target for producing novel dwarfing alleles. In this study, we have characterized additional dwarfing mutations in \emph{Rht-B1} and \emph{Rht-D1}. We show that the severe dwarfism conferred by \emph{Rht-B1c} is caused by an intragenic insertion, which results in an in-frame 90-bp insertion in the transcript and a predicted 30-amino acid insertion within the highly conserved amino-terminal DELLA domain. In contrast, the extreme dwarfism of \emph{Rht-D1c} is due to overexpression of the semidwarfing \emph{Rht-D1b} allele, caused by an increase in gene copy number. We show also that the semidwarfing alleles \emph{Rht-B1d} and \emph{Rht-B1e} introduce premature stop codons within the amino-terminal coding region. Yeast two-hybrid assays indicate that these newly characterized mutations in \emph{Rht-B1} and \emph{Rht-D1} confer ``GA-insensitive'' dwarfism by producing DELLA proteins that do not bind the GA receptor GA INSENSITIVE DWARF1, potentially compromising their targeted degradation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Wheat is undoubtedly one of the world's major food sources since the dawn of Near Eastern agriculture and up to the present day. Morphological, physiological, and genetic modifications involved in domestication and subsequent evolution under domestication were investigated in a tetraploid recombinant inbred line population, derived from a cross between durum wheat and its immediate progenitor wild emmer wheat. Experimental data were used to test previous assumptions regarding a protracted domestication process. The brittle rachis (Br) spike, thought to be a primary characteristic of domestication, was mapped to chromosome 2A as a single gene, suggesting, in light of previously reported Br loci (homoeologous group 3), a complex genetic model involved in spike brittleness. Twenty-seven quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring threshability and yield components (kernel size and number of kernels per spike) were mapped. The large number of QTLs detected in this and other studies suggests that following domestication, wheat evolutionary processes involved many genomic changes. The Br gene did not show either genetic (co-localization with QTLs) or phenotypic association with threshability or yield components, suggesting independence of the respective loci. It is argued here that changes in spike threshability and agronomic traits (e.g. yield and its components) are the outcome of plant evolution under domestication, rather than the result of a protracted domestication process. Revealing the genomic basis of wheat domestication and evolution under domestication, and clarifying their inter-relationships, will improve our understanding of wheat biology and contribute to further crop improvement.},

MacKey] cultivar Langdon and wild emmer wheat [T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides (K\"orn.) Thell.] accession G18-16. One hundred and fifty-two single-seed descent derived F6 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were analyzed with a total of 690 loci, including 197 microsatellite and 493 DArT markers. Linkage analysis defined 14 linkage groups. Most markers were mapped to the B-genome (60\%), with an average of 57 markers per chromosome and the remaining 40\% mapped to the A-genome, with an average of 39 markers per chromosome. To construct a stabilized (skeleton) map, markers interfering with map stability were removed. The skeleton map consisted of 307 markers with a total length of 2,317 cM and average distance of 7.5 cM between adjacent markers. The length of individual chromosomes ranged between 112 cM for chromosome 4B to 217 cM for chromosome 3B. A fraction (30.1\%) of the markers deviated significantly from the expected Mendelian ratios; clusters of loci showing distorted segregation were found on chromosomes 1A, 1BL, 2BS, 3B, and 4B. DArT markers showed high proportion of clustering, which may be indicative of gene-rich regions. Three hundred and fifty-two new DArT markers were mapped for the first time on the current map. This map provides a useful groundwork for further genetic analyses of important quantitative traits, positional cloning, and marker-assisted selection, as well as for genome comparative genomics and genome organization studies in wheat and other cereals.},

  abstract = {Ca2+ is a universal intracellular messenger that controls a wide range of cellular processes. In pancreatic acinar cells, acetylcholine and cholecystokinin regulate secretion via generation of repetitive local cytosolic Ca2+ signals in the apical pole. Bile acids and non-oxidative alcohol metabolites can elicit abnormal cytosolic Ca2+ signals that are global and sustained and result in necrosis. Necrosis results from excessive loss of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum, which is mediated by Ca2+ release through specific channels and inhibition of Ca 2+ pumps in intracellular stores, followed by entry of extracellular Ca2+. Reduction of the cellular ATP level has a major role in this process. These abnormal Ca2+ signals, which can be inhibited by caffeine, explain how excessive alcohol intake and biliary disease cause acute pancreatitis, an often-fatal human disease in which the pancreas digests itself and its surroundings. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Common wheat (Triticum aestivum) has for decades been a textbook example of the evolution of a major crop species by allopolyploidization. Using a sophisticated extension of the PCR technique, we have successfully isolated two single-copy nuclear genes, DMC1 and EF\textendash G, from each of the three genomes found in hexaploid wheat (BAuD) and from the two genomes of the tetraploid progenitor Triticum turgidum (BAu). By subjecting these sequences to phylogenetic analysis together with sequences from representatives of all the diploid Triticeae genera we are able for the Wrst time to provide simultaneous and strongly supported evidence for the D genome being derived from Aegilops tauschii, the Au genome being derived from Triticum urartu, and the hitherto enigmatic B genome being derived from Aegilops speltoides. Previous problems of identifying the B genome donor may be associated with a higher diversiWcation rate of the B genome compared to the Au genome in the polyploid wheats. The phylogenetic hypothesis further suggests that neither Triticum, Aegilops, nor Triticum plus Aegilops are monophyletic.},

Despite the identification of several genes that cause hybrid sterility or inviability\textemdash many of which have evolved rapidly under positive Darwinian selection\textemdash little is known about the ecological or genomic forces that drive the evolution of postzygotic isolation. Here, we show that the same gene, Overdrive, causes both male sterility and segregation distortion in F1 hybrids between the Bogota and U.S. subspecies of Drosophila pseudoobscura. This segregation distorter gene is essential for hybrid sterility, a strong reproductive barrier between these young taxa. Our results suggest that genetic conflict may be an important evolutionary force in speciation. A Drosophila gene that causes sterility in the offspring of two species and may be important for speciation causes increased transmission of itself to progeny.

The current view is based on limited data sets, either a single gene with many species (e.g., ribosomal RNA) or many genes but with only a few species. Because a reliable phylogenetic inference simultaneously requires numerous genes and numerous species, we assembled a very large data set containing 129 orthologous proteins ( approximately 30,000 aligned amino acid positions) for 36 eukaryotic species. Included in the alignments are data from the choanoflagellate Monosiga ovata, obtained through the sequencing of about 1,000 cDNAs. We provide conclusive support for choanoflagellates as the closest relative of animals and for fungi as the second closest. The monophyly of Plantae and chromalveolates was recovered but without strong statistical support. Within animals, in contrast to the monophyly of Coelomata observed in several recent large-scale analyses, we recovered a paraphyletic Coelamata, with nematodes and platyhelminths nested within. To include a diverse sample of organisms, data from EST projects were used for several species, resulting in a large amount of missing data in our alignment (about 25\%). By using different approaches, we verify that the inferred phylogeny is not sensitive to these missing data. Therefore, this large data set provides a reliable phylogenetic framework for studying eukaryotic and animal evolution and will be easily extendable when large amounts of sequence information become available from a broader taxonomic range.},

  abstract = {Despite expanding data sets and advances in phylogenomic methods, deep-level metazoan relationships remain highly controversial. Recent phylogenomic analyses depart from classical concepts in recovering ctenophores as the earliest branching metazoan taxon and propose a sister-group relationship between sponges and cnidarians (e.g., Dunn CW, Hejnol A, Matus DQ, et al. (18 co-authors). 2008. Broad phylogenomic sampling improves resolution of the animal tree of life. Nature 452:745-749). Here, we argue that these results are artifacts stemming from insufficient taxon sampling and long-branch attraction (LBA). By increasing taxon sampling from previously unsampled nonbilaterians and using an identical gene set to that reported by Dunn et al., we recover monophyletic Porifera as the sister group to all other Metazoa. This suggests that the basal position of the fast-evolving Ctenophora proposed by Dunn et al. was due to LBA and that broad taxon sampling is of fundamental importance to metazoan phylogenomic analyses. Additionally, saturation in the Dunn et al. character set is comparatively high, possibly contributing to the poor support for some nonbilaterian nodes.},

  abstract = {Understanding how complex traits, such as epithelia, nervous systems, muscles, or guts, originated depends on a well-supported hypothesis about the phylogenetic relationships among major animal lineages. Traditionally, sponges (Porifera) have been interpreted as the sister group to the remaining animals, a hypothesis consistent with the conventional view that the last common animal ancestor was relatively simple and more complex body plans arose later in evolution. However, this premise has recently been challenged by analyses of the genomes of comb jellies (Ctenophora), which, instead, found ctenophores as the sister group to the remaining animals (the "Ctenophora-sister" hypothesis). Because ctenophores are morphologically complex predators with true epithelia, nervous systems, muscles, and guts, this scenario implies these traits were either present in the last common ancestor of all animals and were lost secondarily in sponges and placozoans (Trichoplax) or, alternatively, evolved convergently in comb jellies. Here, we analyze representative datasets from recent studies supporting Ctenophora-sister, including genome-scale alignments of concatenated protein sequences, as well as a genomic gene content dataset. We found no support for Ctenophora-sister and conclude it is an artifact resulting from inadequate methodology, especially the use of simplistic evolutionary models and inappropriate choice of species to root the metazoan tree. Our results reinforce a traditional scenario for the evolution of complexity in animals, and indicate that inferences about the evolution of Metazoa based on the Ctenophora-sister hypothesis are not supported by the currently available data.},

STRUCTURE can identify subsets of the whole sample by detecting allele frequency differences within the data and can assign individuals to those sub-populations based on analysis of likelihoods. The review covers STRUCTURE's most commonly used ancestry and frequency models, plus an overview of the main applications of the software in human genetics including case-control association studies (CCAS), population genetics, and forensic analysis. The review is accompanied by supplementary material providing a step-by-step guide to running STRUCTURE., Methods: With reference to a worked example, we explore the effects of changing the principal analysis parameters on STRUCTURE results when analyzing a uniform set of human genetic data. Use of the supporting software: CLUMPP and distruct is detailed and we provide an overview and worked example of STRAT software, applicable to CCAS., Conclusion: The guide offers a simplified view of how STRUCTURE, CLUMPP, distruct, and STRAT can be applied to provide researchers with an informed choice of parameter settings and supporting software when analyzing their own genetic data.},

  abstract = {Recombination is a key evolutionary process that shapes the architecture of genomes and the genetic structure of populations. Although many statistical methods are available for the detection of recombination from DNA sequences, their absolute and relative performance is still unknown. Here we evaluated the performance of 14 different recombination detection algorithms. We used the coalescent with recombination to simulate DNA sequences with different levels of recombination, genetic diversity, and rate variation among sites. Recombination detection methods were applied to these data sets, and whether they detected or not recombination was recorded. Different recombination methods showed distinct performance depending on the amount of recombination, genetic diversity, and rate variation among sites. The model of nucleotide substitution under which the data were generated did not seem to have a significant effect. Most methods increase power with more sequence divergence. In general, recombination detection methods seem to capture the presence of recombination, but they are not very powerful. Methods that use substitution patterns or incompatibility among sites were more powerful than methods based on phylogenetic incongruence. Most methods do not seem to infer more false positives than expected by chance. Especially depending on the amount of diversity in the data, different methods could be used to attain maximum power while minimizing false positives. Results shown here will provide some guidance in the selection of the most appropriate method/s for the analysis of the particular data at hand.},

To explain and unify these two aspects of animal space use, we use recently developed mechanistic models of collective animal movement. We apply our approach to a natural experiment on an urban red fox (Vulpes vulpes) population that underwent a rapid decline in population density due to a sarcoptic mange epizooty. By extracting details of movement and interaction strategies from location data, we show how foxes alter their behavior, taking advantage of sudden population-level changes by acquiring areas vacated due to neighbor mortality, while ensuring territory boundaries remain contiguous. The rate of territory border movement increased eightfold as the population declined and the foxes' response time to neighboring scent reduced by a third. By demonstrating how observed, fluctuating territorial patterns emerge from movements and interactions of individual animals, our results give the first data-validated, mechanistic explanation of the elastic disc hypothesis, proposed nearly 80 years ago.},

To determine whether or not the chimpanzee infers states of this kind, we showed an adult chimpanzee a series of videotaped scenes of a human actor struggling with a variety of problems. Some problems were simple, involving inaccessible food - bananas vertically or horizontally out of reach, behind a box, and so forth - as in the original Kohler problems; others were more complex, involving an actor unable to extricate himself from a locked cage, shivering because of a malfunctioning heater, or unable to play a phonograph because it was unplugged. With each videotape the chimpanzee was given several photographs, one a solution to the problem, such as a stick for the inaccessible bananas, a key for the locked up actor, a lit wick for the malfunctioning heater. The chimpanzee's consistent choice of the correct photographs can be understood by assuming that the animal recognized the videotape as representing a problem, understood the actor's purpose, and chose alternatives compatible with that purpose.},

  abstract = {Like most angiosperms, wheat (Triticum aestivum) shows maternal inheritance of plastids. It is thought that this takes place by cytoplasmic stripping at fertilisation rather than the absence of plastids in sperm cells. To determine the fate of plastids during sperm cell development, plastid-targeted green fluorescent protein was used to visualise these organelles in nuclear transgenic wheat lines. Fewer than thirty small 1\textendash 2-{$\mu$}m plastids were visible in early uninucleate pollen cells. These dramatically increased to several hundred larger (4 {$\mu$}m) plastids during pollen maturation and went through distinct morphological changes. Only small plastids were visible in generative cells (n = 25) and young sperm cells (n = 9). In mature sperm cells, these green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged plastids were absent. This is consistent with maternal inheritance of plastids resulting from their degradation in mature sperm cells in wheat.},

We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g. , seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

Aegilops species are a potential future resource for wheat breeding for traits such as adaptation to different ecological conditions and pest and disease resistance. This study describes the development and application of the first high-throughput genotyping platform specifically designed for screening wheat relative species. The platform was used to screen multiple accessions representing all species in the genus Aegilops. Firstly, the data was demonstrated to be useful for screening diversity and examining relationships within and between Aegilops species.

  abstract = {Many of the major transitions in evolution involved the coalescence of independent lower-level units into a higher organismal level. This paper examines the role of kinship, focusing on the transitions to multicellularity in animals and to coloniality in insects. In both, kin selection based on high relatedness permitted cooperation and a reproductive division of labour. The higher relatedness of haplodiploid females to their sisters than to their offspring might not have been crucial in the origin of insect societies, and the transition to multicellularity shows that such special relationships are not required. When multicellular forms develop from a single cell, selfish conflict is minimal because each selfish mutant obtains only one generation of within-individual advantage in a chimaera. Conditionally expressed traits are particularly immune to within-individual selfishness because such mutations are rarely expressed in chimaeras. Such conditionally expressed altruism genes lead easily to the evolution of the soma, and the germ line might simply be what is left over. In most social insects, differences in relatedness ensure that there will be potential conflicts. Power asymmetries sometimes lead to such decisive settlements of conflicts that social insect colonies can be considered to be fully organismal.},

Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described},

  abstract = {Making more of your stomata Stomata on grasses are made up of two guard cells and two subsidiary cells, and they perform better than stomata on broad-leaved plants, which are made up only of two guard cells. Raissig et al. found that the MUTE transcription factor in the wheat-like grass Brachypodium is a little bigger than the equivalent protein in the model broad-leaved plant Arabidopsis. The extension in the grass protein promotes its movement into adjacent cells, prompting them to become subsidiary cells. Mutant Brachypodium whose MUTE protein could not move between cells lacked stomatal subsidiary cells and grew poorly. Science, this issue p. 1215 Plants optimize carbon assimilation while limiting water loss by adjusting stomatal aperture. In grasses, a developmental innovation\textemdash the addition of subsidiary cells (SCs) flanking two dumbbell-shaped guard cells (GCs)\textemdash is linked to improved stomatal physiology. Here, we identify a transcription factor necessary and sufficient for SC formation in the wheat relative Brachypodium distachyon. Unexpectedly, the transcription factor is an ortholog of the stomatal regulator AtMUTE, which defines GC precursor fate in Arabidopsis. The novel role of BdMUTE in specifying lateral SCs appears linked to its acquisition of cell-to-cell mobility in Brachypodium. Physiological analyses on SC-less plants experimentally support classic hypotheses that SCs permit greater stomatal responsiveness and larger range of pore apertures. Manipulation of SC formation and function in crops, therefore, may be an effective approach to enhance plant performance. Mobile transcription factor builds better stomata in grasses. Mobile transcription factor builds better stomata in grasses.},

  abstract = {Microsatellite markers are extensively used to evaluate genetic diversity in natural or experimental evolving populations. Their high degree of polymorphism reflects their high mutation rates. Estimates of the mutation rates are therefore necessary when characterizing diversity in populations. As a complement to the classical experimental designs, we propose to use experimental populations, where the initial state is entirely known and some intermediate states have been thoroughly surveyed, thus providing a short timescale estimation together with a large number of cumulated meioses. In this article, we derived four original gene genealogy-based methods to assess mutation rates with limited bias due to relevant model assumptions incorporating the initial state, the number of new alleles, and the genetic effective population size. We studied the evolution of genetic diversity at 21 microsatellite markers, after 15 generations in an experimental wheat population. Compared to the parents, 23 new alleles were found in generation 15 at 9 of the 21 loci studied. We provide evidence that they arose by mutation. Corresponding estimates of the mutation rates ranged from 0 to 4.97 \texttimes{} 10-3 per generation (i.e., year). Sequences of several alleles revealed that length polymorphism was only due to variation in the core of the microsatellite. Among different microsatellite characteristics, both the motif repeat number and an independent estimation of the Nei diversity were correlated with the novel diversity. Despite a reduced genetic effective size, global diversity at microsatellite markers increased in this population, suggesting that microsatellite diversity should be used with caution as an indicator in biodiversity conservation issues.},

Social learning has been experimentally demonstrated in at least 23 field experiments, in 20 species, covering a range of contexts, such as foraging preferences and techniques, habitat choice, and predator avoidance. We review experimental approaches taken in the field and with wild animals brought into captivity and note how these approaches can be extended. Relocating individuals, introducing trained individual demonstrators or novel behaviors into a population, or providing demonstrator-manipulated artifacts can establish whether and how a particular act can be socially transmitted in the wild and can help elucidate the benefits of social learning. The type, strength, and consistency of presented social information can be varied, and the provision of conditions favoring the performance of an act can both establish individual discovery rates and help determine whether social information is needed for acquisition. By blocking particular avenues of social transmission or removing key individuals, routes of transmission in wild populations can be investigated. Manipulation of conditions proposed to favor social learning can test mathematical models of the evolution of social learning. We illustrate how field experiments are a viable, vital, and informative approach to the study of social learning.},

However, it is not known which red light responses are controlled by which phytochrome species, or whether the different phytochromes have overlapping functions. We report here that previously described hy3 mutants have mutations in the gene coding for phytochrome B (PhyB). These are the first mutations shown to lie in a plant photoreceptor gene. A number of tissues are abnormally elongated in the hy3(phyB) mutants, including hypocotyls, stems, petioles, and root hairs. In addition, the mutants flower earlier than the wild type, and they accumulate less chlorophyll. PhyB thus controls Arabidopsis development at numerous stages and in multiple tissues.},

In Arabidopsis thaliana, there are genes encoding at least five phytochromes, and it is of interest to learn if the different phytochromes have overlapping or distinct functions. To address this question for two of the phytochromes in Arabidopsis, we have compared light responses of the wild type with those of a phyA null mutant, a phyB null mutant, and a phyA phyB double mutant. We have found that both phyA and phyB mutants have a deficiency in germination, the phyA mutant in far-red light and the phyB mutant in the dark. Furthermore, the germination defect caused by the phyA mutation in far- red light could be suppressed by a phyB mutation, suggesting that phytochrome B (PHYB) can have an inhibitory as well as a stimulatory effect on germination. In red light, the phyA phyB double mutant, but neither single mutant, had poorly developed cotyledons, as well as reduced red-light induction of CAB gene expression and potentiation of chlorophyll induction. The phyA mutant was deficient in sensing a flowering response inductive photoperiod, suggesting that PHYA participates in sensing daylength. In contrast, the phyB mutant flowered earlier than the wild type (and the phyA mutant) under all photoperiods tested, but responded to an inductive photoperiod. Thus, PHYA and PHYB appear to have complementary functions in controlling germination, seedling development, and flowering. We discuss the implications of these results for possible mechanisms of PHYA and PHYB signal transduction.},

Existing models have limitations with respect to their analytic potential, their compatibility with insights into mechanistic aspects of meiosis, and their treatment of model parameters in terms of parameter dependencies. In this article I put forward a computational approach to the probabilistic modeling of meiosis. A computer program enumerates all possible paths through the phases of replication, pairing, recombination, and segregation, while keeping track of the probabilities of the paths according to the various parameters involved. Probabilities for classes of genotypes or phenotypes are added, and the resulting formulas are simplified by the symbolic-computation system Mathematica. An example application to autotetraploids results in a model that remedies the limitations of previous models mentioned above. In addition to the immediate implications, the computational approach presented here can be expected to be useful through opening avenues for modeling a host of processes, including meiosis in higher-order ploidies.},

The main objective of this study was to examine the loss of genetic diversity in spring bread wheat during (1) its domestication, (2) the change from traditional landrace cultivars (LCs) to modern breeding varieties, and (3) 50~years of international breeding. We studied 253 CIMMYT or CIMMYT-related modern wheat cultivars, LCs, and Triticum tauschii accessions, the D-genome donor of wheat, with 90 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers dispersed across the wheat genome. A loss of genetic diversity was observed from T. tauschii to the LCs, and from the LCs to the elite breeding germplasm. Wheat's genetic diversity was narrowed from 1950 to 1989, but was enhanced from 1990 to 1997. Our results indicate that breeders averted the narrowing of the wheat germplasm base and subsequently increased the genetic diversity through the introgression of novel materials. The LCs and T. tauschii contain numerous unique alleles that were absent in modern spring bread wheat cultivars. Consequently, both the LCs and T. tauschii represent useful sources for broadening the genetic base of elite wheat breeding germplasm.},

  abstract = {Tropical rain forests harbour the most diverse plant and animal assemblages known to science, but our understanding of assemblage structure and species interactions is limited. Bats, as the only flying mammals, have the potential to exploit resources from all strata in forest communities. Thus, fruit-eating phyllostomid bats often have been categorized into canopy-, subcanopy- and understorey-foraging species, based largely upon the height at which they were most frequently captured. Here we challenge this classification and use stable carbon isotopes to assess foraging height of bat species at an Amazonian rain-forest site in Ecuador and at a Caribbean lowland rain-forest site in Costa Rica for comparison with data from mist-net captures. The proportion of the heavy stable carbon isotope 13C in relation to the lighter 12C isotope increases in plants from ground level to the canopy (0.12\textperthousand{} m-1\textendash 0.18\textperthousand{} m-1), and these differences in stable carbon isotope signatures are reflected in the body tissue of phytophagous bats. We used the stable carbon isotope ratio ({$\delta$}13C) of wing tissue to estimate the foraging heights of 54 phyllostomid species in twoNeotropical bat assemblages. Based on stable isotope data, phyllostomid species exploit food resources at all verticalstrata of the forest. Capture height was not a reliable predictor of foraging height and suggests that bats most likelyuse lower strata to commute between foraging sites to avoid predators. Vertical stratification is likely to be a key factorpromoting niche partitioning, thus promoting high local species richness in many tropical animal assemblages},

The use of genomic dot-blot hybridisation allows the detection of small Hordeum chilense genomic introgressions in the descendants of genetic crosses between wheat and H. chilense addition or substitution lines in wheat when molecular markers are difficult to use. Based on genomic in situ hybridisation, DNA samples from wheat lines carrying putatively H. chilense introgressions were immobilised on a membrane, blocked with wheat genomic DNA and hybridised with biotin-labelled H. chilense genomic DNA as a probe. This dot-blot screening reduced the number of plants necessary to be analysed by molecular markers or in situ hybridisation, saving time and money. The technique was sensitive enough to detect a minimum of 5 ng of total genomic DNA immobilised on the membrane or about 1/420 dilution of H. chilense genomic DNA in the wheat background. The robustness of the technique was verified by in situ hybridisation. In addition, the detection of other wheat relative species such as Hordeum vulgare, Secale cereale and Agropyron cristatum in the wheat background was also reported.},

  abstract = {Wild relatives provide an important source of useful traits in wheat breeding. Wheat and wild relative hybrids have been widely used in breeding programs to introduce such traits into wheat. However, successful introgression is limited by the low frequency of homoeologous crossover (CO) between wheat and wild relative chromosomes. Hybrids between wheat carrying a 70Mb deletion on chromosome 5B (ph1b) and wild relatives, have been exploited to increase the level of homoeologous CO, allowing chromosome exchange between their chromosomes. In ph1b-rye hybrids, CO number increases from a mean of 1 CO to 7 COs per cell. CO number can be further increased up to a mean of 12 COs per cell in these ph1b hybrids by treating the plants with Hoagland solution. More recently, it was shown that the major meiotic crossover gene ZIP4 on chromosome 5B (TaZIP4-B2) within the 70Mb deletion, was responsible for the restriction of homoeologous COs in wheat-wild relative hybrids, confirming the ph1b phenotype as a complete Tazip4-B2 deletion mutant (Tazip4-B2 ph1b). In this study, we have identified the particular Hoagland solution constituent responsible for the increased chiasma frequency in Tazip4-B2 ph1b mutant-rye hybrids and extended the analysis to Tazip4-B2 TILLING and CRISPR mutant-Ae variabilis hybrids. Chiasma frequency at meiotic metaphase I, in the absence of each Hoagland solution macronutrient (NH4 H2PO4, KNO3, Ca (NO3)2\textbullet 4H2O or Mg SO4\textbullet 7H2O) was analysed. A significant decrease in homoeologous CO frequency was observed when the Mg2+ ion was absent. A significant increase of homoeologous CO frequency was observed in all analysed hybrids, when plants were irrigated with a 1mM Mg2+ solution. These observations suggest a role for magnesium supplementation in improving the success of genetic material introgression from wild relatives into wheat.},

The ant Temnothorax albipennis recently satisfied a strict set of predefined criteria for teaching in nonhuman animals [9, 10]. These criteria do not include evaluation as a prerequisite for teaching [10]. However, some authors claim that true teaching is always evaluative, i.e., sensitive to the competence or quality of the pupil [11-13]. They then assume, on the premise that only humans are capable of making such necessarily complex cognitive evaluations, that teaching must be unique to humans. We conducted experiments to test whether evaluation occurs during tandem running, in which a knowledgeable ant physically guides a naive follower to a goal. In each experiment, we interrupted the tandem run by removing the tandem follower. The response of the leader was to stand still at the point where the tandem run was interrupted. We then measured how long the leader waited for the missing follower before giving??up. Our results demonstrate T. albipennis performs three different kinds of evaluation. First, the longer the tandem has proceeded the longer the leader will wait for??the follower to re-establish contact. Second, ant teachers modulate their giving-up time depending on the value of the goal. Finally, leaders have shorter giving-up times after unusually slow tandem runs. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Because of their abundance and their amenability to high-throughput genotyping techniques, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are powerful tools for efficient genetics and genomics studies, including characterization of genetic resources, genome-wide association studies and genomic selection. In wheat, most of the previous SNP discovery initiatives targeted the coding fraction, leaving almost 98\% of the wheat genome largely unexploited. Here we report on the use of whole-genome resequencing data from eight wheat lines to mine for SNPs in the genic, the repetitive and non-repetitive intergenic fractions of the wheat genome. Eventually, we identified 3.3 million SNPs, 49\% being located on the B-genome, 41\% on the A-genome and 10\% on the D-genome. We also describe the development of the TaBW280K high-throughput genotyping array containing 280,226 SNPs. Performance of this chip was examined by genotyping a set of 96 wheat accessions representing the worldwide diversity.

  abstract = {Among the fundamental evolutionary forces, recombination arguably has the largest impact on the practical work of plant breeders. Varying over 1,000-fold across the maize genome, the local meiotic recombination rate limits the resolving power of quantitative trait mapping and the precision of favorable allele introgression. The consequences of low recombination also theoretically extend to the species-wide scale by decreasing the power of selection relative to genetic drift, and thereby hindering the purging of deleterious mutations. In this study, we used genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to identify 136,000 recombination breakpoints at high resolution within US and Chinese maize nested association mapping populations. We find that the pattern of cross-overs is highly predictable on the broad scale, following the distribution of gene density and CpG methylation. Several large inversions also suppress recombination in distinct regions of several families. We also identify recombination hotspots ranging in size from 1 kb to 30 kb. We find these hotspots to be historically stable and, compared with similar regions with low recombination, to have strongly differentiated patterns of DNA methylation and GC content. We also provide evidence for the historical action of GC-biased gene conversion in recombination hotspots. Finally, using genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) to identify putative deleterious polymorphisms, we find evidence for reduced genetic load in hotspot regions, a phenomenon that may have considerable practical importance for breeding programs worldwide.},

It has been observed that the variance of the rate of evolution is generally larger than expected according to the neutrality theory, which has raised the question of how reliable the molecular clock is or, indeed, whether there is a molecular clock at all. We have carried out an extensive investigation of three proteins, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH). We have observed that (i) the three proteins evolve erratically through time and across lineages and (ii) the erratic patterns of acceleration and deceleration differ from locus to locus, so that one locus may evolve faster in one than another lineage, whereas the opposite may be the case for another locus. The observations are inconsistent with the predictions made by various subsidiary hypotheses proposed to account for the overdispersion of the molecular clock.},

We consider a spectrum of situations with intrachromosomal heterogeneity of recombination rate, different level of genotyping errors, and missing data. In the ideal scenario of the absence of errors and missing data, the majority of markers should appear as groups of cosegregating markers (``twins'') representing no challenge for map construction. The central aspect of the proposed approach is to take into account the structure of the marker space, where each twin group (TG) and singleton markers are represented as points of this space. The confounding effect of genotyping errors and missing data leads to reduction of TG size, but upon a low level of these effects surviving TGs can still be used as a source of reliable skeletal markers. Increase in the level of confounding effects results in a considerable decrease in the number or even disappearance of usable TGs and, correspondingly, of skeletal markers. Here, we show that the paucity of informative markers can be compensated by detecting kernels of markers in the marker space using a clustering procedure, and demonstrate the utility of this approach for high-density genetic map construction on simulated and experimentally obtained genotyping datasets.},

Screening of whole-genome resequencing data from 429 chickpea lines identified 4.9 million SNPs, from which a subset of 70 463 high-quality nonredundant SNPs was selected using different stringent filter criteria. This was further narrowed down to 61 174 SNPs based on p-convert score {$\geq$}0.3, of which 50 590 SNPs could be tiled on array. Among these tiled SNPs, a total of 11 245 SNPs (22.23\%) were from the coding regions of 3673 different genes. The developed Axiom\textregistered CicerSNP Array was used for genotyping two recombinant inbred line populations, namely ICCRIL03 (ICC 4958 \texttimes{} ICC 1882) and ICCRIL04 (ICC 283 \texttimes{} ICC 8261). Genotyping data reflected high success and polymorphic rate, with 15 140 (29.93\%; ICCRIL03) and 20 018 (39.57\%; ICCRIL04) polymorphic SNPs. High-density genetic maps comprising 13 679 SNPs spanning 1033.67 cM and 7769 SNPs spanning 1076.35 cM were developed for ICCRIL03 and ICCRIL04 populations, respectively. QTL analysis using multilocation, multiseason phenotyping data on these RILs identified 70 (ICCRIL03) and 120 (ICCRIL04) main-effect QTLs on genetic map. Higher precision and potential of this array is expected to advance chickpea genetics and breeding applications.},

  abstract = {Neandertal growth patterns The ontogeny of different parts of the Neandertal skeleton has been derived from isolated bones and fragments. Rosas et al. present a more complete skeleton of a Neandertal child, aged 7 to 8 years, from a 49,000-year-old site in northern Spain. The skeleton preserves dental, cranial, and postcranial material, allowing the assessment of dental and skeletal maturation with age. Most of the elements indicate an overall growth rate similar to that of modern human children. The main difference between Neandertals and modern humans is in the vertebral column. Also, several features indicate ongoing brain growth. The pattern of vertebral maturation and extended brain growth might reflect the broad Neandertal body form and physiology, rather than a fundamental difference in the overall pace of growth in Neandertals. Science, this issue p. 1282 Ontogenetic studies help us understand the processes of evolutionary change. Previous studies on Neandertals have focused mainly on dental development and inferred an accelerated pace of general growth. We report on a juvenile partial skeleton (El Sidr\'on J1) preserving cranio-dental and postcranial remains. We used dental histology to estimate the age at death to be 7.7 years. Maturation of most elements fell within the expected range of modern humans at this age. The exceptions were the atlas and mid-thoracic vertebrae, which remained at the 5- to 6-year stage of development. Furthermore, endocranial features suggest that brain growth was not yet completed. The vertebral maturation pattern and extended brain growth most likely reflect Neandertal physiology and ontogenetic energy constraints rather than any fundamental difference in the overall pace of growth in this extinct human. Neandertals show differential growth modulation to that of modern humans to accommodate specific brain and body form.

Toward this goal, we have sequenced, assembled, and annotated the genome of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi. Our phylogenomic analyses of both amino acid positions and gene content suggest that ctenophores rather than sponges are the sister lineage to all other animals. Mnemiopsis lacks many of the genes found in bilaterian mesodermal cell types, suggesting that these cell types evolved independently. The set of neural genes in Mnemiopsis is similar to that of sponges, indicating that sponges may have lost a nervous system. These results present a newly supported view of early animal evolution that accounts for major losses and/or gains of sophisticated cell types, including nerve and muscle cells.},

  abstract = {In the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, DNA is amplified in vitro by a series of polymerization cycles consisting of three temperature-dependent steps: DNA denaturatlon, primer-template annealing, and DNA synthesis by a thermostable DNA polymerase. The purity and yield of the reaction products depend on several parameters, one of which is the annealing temperature (Ta). At both sub- and super-optimal Ta values, non-specific products may be formed, and the yield of products is reduced. Optimizing the Ta is especially critical when long products are synthesized or when total genomlc DNA is the substrate for PCR. In this article we experimentally determine the optimal annealing temperature 0V{$>$}PT) values for several primer-template pairs and develop a method for its calculation. The T,097 is found to be a function of the melting temperatures of the less stable primer-template pair and of the product. The fact that experimental and calculated TaOPT values agree to within 0.7\textdegree C eliminates the need for determining TaOPT experimentally. Synthesis of DNA fragments shorter than 1 kb is more efficient if a variable Ta is used, such that the Ta is higher In each consecutive cycle.},

It has been suggested that other vipers, including large ambush predators of the genus Bitis, also may use radiant infrared information for predatory targeting. We compared behavioral responses of pit vipers and snakes of the viperine genus Bitis to paired targets of different temperatures (i.e. cool and warm balloons), some scented with rodent odors. The rates of tongue flicking, head turning and approaches by pit vipers (Agkistrodon contortrix and Crotalus atrox) were significantly higher toward warm targets than toward cool ones. Moreover, they all were significantly higher in pit vipers than in the vipers Bitis arietans, Bitis gabonica, and Bitis nasicornis. Bitis sp. exhibited no significant differences in their behaviors toward warm versus cool targets. Pit vipers often struck at targets (always the warm target even when paired with a prey-scented cool target), but Bitis sp. never struck at either warm or cool targets. These results show that the behavioral correlates of infrared-based predatory and/or defensive targeting differ significantly between these two groups of viperid snakes, and suggest that the neural substrates of infrared imaging in crotaline snakes are either absent or functionally distinct in viperine snakes of the genus Bitis. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

However, little is known about the factors affecting both the distribution and the intensity of recombination along this gradient. To investigate this, we studied in detail the pattern of CO along chromosome 3B of bread wheat. A dense reference genetic map comprising 102 markers homogeneously distributed along the chromosome was compared to a physical deletion map. Most of the COs (90\%) occurred in the distal subtelomeric regions that represent 40\% of the chromosome. About 27\% of the proximal regions surrounding the centromere showed a very weak CO frequency with only three COs found in the 752 gametes studied. Moreover, we observed a clear decrease of CO frequency on the distal region of the short arm. Finally, the intensity of interference was assessed for the first time in wheat using a Gamma model. The results showed m values of 1.2 for male recombination and 3.5 for female recombination, suggesting positive interference along wheat chromosome 3B.},

The genes that govern these traits have similar morphological effects in different species and are syntenic. Reconstructing the genetics of cereal domestication, which occurred {$\sim$}10,000 years ago, is a challenging undertaking, but is facilitated by the genetic analysis of polyploid species.

  abstract = {There is much evidence suggesting that hydrogen cyanide was important in prebiotic synthesis. Here we discuss the relevant aqueous solution chemistry, since we believe it to be pertinent to prebiotic synthesis. In mildly alkaline solutions (pH 7 to 10) two modes of destruction compete. Hydrolysis to formamide and formic acid is first-order in HCN, while polymerization involving the formation of CC bonds is quadratic in HCN. Within the pH range 8 to 9 and the temperature range 0 to 60\textdegree C, the two reactions become equally important for concentrations between 0{$\cdot$}01 M and 0{$\cdot$}1 M; hydrolysis dominates in more dilute and polymerization in more concentrated solutions. Concentration of HCN in the liquid phase by freezing out ice permits efficient polymerization from initially very dilute solutions. Intermediates in the polymerization proceBS include a very reactive trimer, aminomalononitrile, and a relatively stable tetramer, diaminomaleonitrile. The latter is converted to 4-aminoimidazole-5-carbonitrile and related compounds either by photochemical rearrangement or by reaction with formamidine. The imidazole derivatives are then readily converted to purines including adenine, guanine and hypoxanthine. We have also made some observations on the formation of ex-amino acids from HCN oligomers and polymers. Various theories of prebiotic purine formation are considered in the light of the quantitative kinetic data. We conclude that the arguments for a photochemical step are persuasive and that polymerization subsequent to concentration in a eutectic phase is an attractive posiibility.},

Available deletion lines have bracketed the gene-containing regions to about 10\% of the genome. Emerging sequence data suggest that these may further be partitioned into ``mini'' gene-rich and gene-poor regions. An average of about 10\% of each gene-rich region seem to contain genes. Sequence analyses in various species suggest that uneven distribution of genes may be a characteristic of all grasses and perhaps all higher organisms. Comparison of the physical maps with genetic linkage maps showed that recombination in wheat and barley (Hordeum vulgare) is confined to the gene-containing regions. Number of genes, gene density, and the extent of recombination vary greatly among the gene-rich regions. The gene order, relative region size, and recombination are highly conserved within the tribe Triticeae and moderately conserved within the family. Gene-poor regions are composed of retrotransposon-like non-transcribing repeats and pseudogenes. Direct comparisons of orthologous regions indicated that gene density in wheat is about one-half compared with rice (Oryza sativa). Genome size difference between wheat and rice is, therefore, mainly because of amplification of the gene-poor regions. Presence of species-, genera-, and family-specific repeats reveal a repeated invasion of the genomes by different retrotransposons over time. Preferential transposition to adjacent locations and presence of vital genes flanking a gene-rich region may have restricted retrotransposon amplification to gene-poor regions, resulting into tandem blocks of non-transcribing repeats. Insertional inactivation by adjoining retro-elements and selection seem to have played a major role in stabilizing genomes.},

The objective of this study was to reveal the structural and functional organization of the `1S0.8 region' in various Triticeae and other Poaceae species. Consensus genetic linkage maps of the `1S0.8 region' were constructed for wheat, barley, and rye by combining mapping information from 16, 11, and 12 genetic linkage maps, respectively. The consensus genetic linkage maps were compared with each other and with a consensus physical map of wheat homoeologous group 1. Comparative analyses localized 75 agronomically important genes to the `1S0.8 region'. This high-resolution comparison revealed exceptions to the rule of conserved gene synteny, established using low-resolution marker comparisons. Small rearrangements such as duplications, deletions, and inversions were observed among species. Proportion of chromosomal recombination occurring in the `1S0.8 region' was very similar among species. Within the gene-rich region, the extent of recombination was highly variable but the pattern was similar among species. Relative recombination among markers was similar except for a few loci where drastic differences were observed among species. Chromosomal rearrangements did not always change the extent of recombination for the region. Differences in gene order and relative recombination were the least between wheat and barley, and were the highest between wheat and oat.},

  abstract = {The two cultivated rice species, Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima, are morphologically alike but are reproductively isolated from each other by hybrid sterility. The hybrid is male sterile but partially female fertile. Backcross experiments were conducted to introduce an alien factor controlling hybrid sterility from O. glaberrima (W025) into O. sativa (T65wx) and examine the genetic basis. An extracted sterility factor, closely linked to the wx locus, induced gametic abortion due to allelic interaction and was tentatively designated as S(t). The segregation patterns for infertility was explained by assuming that W025 and T65wx carried S(t) and S(t)a, respectively, and gametes with S(t)a aborted only in the heterozygote (S(t)/S(t)a) although the elimination of female gametes was incomplete. Thus, S(t) seemed to be intermediate between a gamete eliminator and pollen killer. However, S(t) was proven to be likely the same as S1 which was formerly reported as gamete eliminator in a different genetic background of O. sativa. In addition, a chromosomal segment containing S1 (or S(t] caused a marked suppression of crossing over around it, suggesting the presence of an inversion. Further, female transmission of S1a increased as the segment containing S1 became small by recombination. After S1 was further purified by successive backcrosses up to the BC15 generation, it became pollen killer.

  abstract = {Background and AimsRubus subgenus Rubus is a group of mostly apomictic and polyploid species with a complicated taxonomy and history of ongoing hybridization. The only polyploid series with prevailing sexuality is the series Glandulosi, although the apomictic series Discolores and Radula also retain a high degree of sexuality, which is influenced by environmental conditions and/or pollen donors. The aim of this study is to detect sources of genetic variability, determine the origin of apomictic taxa and validate microsatellite markers by cloning and sequencing.Methods A total of 206 individuals from two central European regions were genotyped for 11 nuclear microsatellite loci and the chloroplast trnL\textendash trnF region. Microsatellite alleles were further sequenced in order to determine the exact repeat number and to detect size homoplasy due to insertions/deletions in flanking regions.Key Results The results confirm that apomictic microspecies of ser. Radula are derived from crosses between sexual series Glandulosi and apomictic series Discolores, whereby the apomict acts as pollen donor. Each apomictic microspecies is derived from a single distinct genotype differing from the parental taxa, suggesting stabilized clonal reproduction. Intraspecific variation within apomicts is considerably low compared with sexual series Glandulosi, and reflects somatic mutation accumulation. While facultative apomicts produce clonal offspring, sexual species are the conduits of origin for new genetically different apomictic lineages.Conclusions One of the main driving forces of evolution and speciation in the highly apomictic subgenus Rubus in central Europe is sexuality in the series Glandulosi. Palaeovegetation data suggest that initial hybridizations took place over different time periods in the two studied regions, and that the successful origin and spread of apomictic microspecies of the series Radula took place over several millennia. Additionally, the cloning and sequencing show that standard evaluations of microsatellite repeat numbers underestimate genetic variability considering homoplasy in allele size.},

A genetic linkage map consisting of 43 microsatellite markers was constructed using the DH population. Particularly on chromosome 4H microsatellite markers showed distorted segregation ratios. Segregation of DH lines based on molecular markers were compared with segregation of 92 F2 lines from the same cross. The proportion of loci deviating from the expected monogenic segregation ratios in the DH population was significantly higher (19/43loci, 44\%) than in the F2 population (7/43 loci, 16\%). The deviation was biased towards the WI2291 parent alleles.

Each organ consists of a tiny sensory disc (diameter 120-130 microm) which serves as an absorbing structure for IR radiation. The disc is arranged above an air-filled cavity which is located just anteriorly to the coxae of the prothoracic legs. Inside the disc, about 30 multipolar thermoreceptors (warmth receptors) are tightly attached to the cuticle which is directed to the outside. The many dendrites of each multipolar neuron are tightly wrapped around the soma and contain a large number of mitochondria. Absorption of IR radiation by the disc causes an increase in temperature which is measured by the warmth receptors. Therefore, the IR receptors of A. nigricans can be classified as microbolometers with reduced thermal mass and in principle can be compared to the IR organs of pit vipers.},

When the organ was stimulated with a thermal radiator whose emission spectrum was similar to that of a typical forest fire, units responded phasically with up to seven spikes within 30\textendash 40 ms at a radiation power of 24 mW cm -2 . In the experiments all wavelengths shorter than 1.6 {$\mu$}m were excluded by a longpass IR filter. Response latencies were about 4 ms and initial impulse frequencies were up to 250 impulses per second (ips). A single spike could be generated even when stimulus duration was only 2 ms. Reduction of total radiation power from 24 mW cm -2 to 5 mW cm -2 resulted in increased response latencies of 5\textendash 6 ms and the occurrence of only two to three spikes. Initial impulse frequencies decreased to 125 ips. According to our physiological results and calculations, Melanophila should be able to detect a 10-hectare fire from a distance of 12 km. Mechanical stimuli also evoked responses of the IR sensilla. All present morphological and physiological findings lead to the conclusion that the IR receptors of Melanophila must function by means of a hitherto undescribed photomechanic mechanism.},

Corvids, a large-brained group of birds, have been suggested to have undergone a convergent evolution of intelligence [Emery \& Clayton (2004) Science, Vol. 306, pp. 1903-1907]. Here we review evidence for the proposal from both ultimate and proximate perspectives. While we show that many of the proposed hypotheses for the evolutionary origin of great ape intelligence also apply to corvids, further study is needed to reveal the selective pressures that resulted in the evolution of intelligent behaviour in both corvids and apes. For comparative proximate analyses we emphasize the need to be explicit about the level of analysis to reveal the type of convergence that has taken place. Although there is evidence that corvids and apes solve social and physical problems with similar speed and flexibility, there is a great deal more to be learned about the representations and algorithms underpinning these computations in both groups. We discuss recent comparative work that has addressed proximate questions at this level, and suggest directions for future research.},

One inversion spanning a 5-cM region in rice and three deletion bins in wheat was identified.

Globally in wheat, no sequence homology ESTs mapped to the terminal bins, and ESTs rarely mapped to interstitial chromosomal regions known to be recombination hot spots.

Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) is one of the uniplex SNP genotyping platforms, and has evolved to be a global benchmark technology. However, there are no publications relating either to the technology itself or to its application in crop improvement programs. In this review, we provide an overview of the different aspects of the KASP genotyping platform, discuss its application in crop improvement, and compare it with the chip-based Illumina GoldenGate platform. The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center routinely uses KASP, generating in excess of a million data points annually for crop improvement purposes. We found that (1) 81~\% of the SNPs used in a custom-designed GoldenGate assay were transferable to KASP; (2) using KASP, negative controls (no template) consistently clustered together and rarely produced signals exceeding the threshold values for allele calling, in contrast to the situation observed using GoldenGate assays; (3) KASP's average genotyping error in positive control DNA samples was 0.7\textendash 1.6~\%, which is lower than that observed using GoldenGate (2.0\textendash 2.4~\%); (4) KASP genotyping costs for marker-assisted recurrent selection were 7.9\textendash 46.1~\% cheaper than those of the BeadXpress and GoldenGate platforms; and (5) KASP offers cost-effective and scalable flexibility in applications that require small to moderate numbers of markers, such as quality control analysis, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in bi-parental populations, marker-assisted recurrent selection, marker-assisted backcrossing, and QTL fine mapping.},

The RING motif protein COP1 is also important because cop1 mutants exhibit constitutive photomorphogenesis in darkness. COP1 is present in the nucleus in darkness but is gradually relocated to the cytoplasm upon illumination. Here we show that COP1 functions as an E3 ligase ubiquitinating both itself and the myb transcription activator LAF1, which is required for complete phyA responses. In transgenic plants, inducible COP1 overexpression leads to a decrease in LAF1 concentrations, but is blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. The coiled-coil domain of SPA1, a negative regulator of phyA signalling, has no effect on COP1 auto-ubiquitination but facilitates LAF1 ubiquitination at low COP1 concentrations. These results indicate that, in darkness, COP1 functions as a repressor of photomorphogenesis by promoting the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of a subset of positive regulators, including LAF1. After the activation of phyA, SPA1 stimulates the E3 activity of residual nuclear COP1 to ubiquitinate LAF1, thereby desensitizing phyA signals.},

The Ivlev index was employed to evaluate the degree to which the crustaceans were selected in favour of other prey. Stomach content data were weighted to the abundance of the predators in the environment in accordance with the abundance indices obtained in the area with a bottom trawl survey, when all the data were collected. Selection of the crustaceans as a group varied, depending on whether biomass/volume or number was being studied, with the former value negative and the latter positive. Due to the importance of the fish biomass as prey for the predators studied. The highest mean value of the Ivlev index was obtained for the benthic shrimp Processa spp. Other prey species with a high index were Pandalina brevirostris and the Crangonidae, and to a lesser extent Portunidae, Scyllarus arctus, Alpheus glaber, Lophogaster typicus and the Amphipoda. Processa spp. And Galathea spp. Occurred in 15 of the 18 fish species analysed. Other more armed or protected species were negatively selected and were less important as prey, e.g. Nephrops norvegicus, Dichelopandalus bonnieri, Plesionika heterocarpus and the Paguridae. The predators studied were also classified according to trophic spectrum and the importance of macrobenthic crustaceans in their diet. Scyliorhinus canicula. Raja clavata and Lepidorhombus boscil showed the highest mean Ivlev index and diet diversity, while the lowest was for Pagellus acarne and Chelidonichthys obscurus.},

Biased transmission of alleles, or segregation distortion, can result from a number of biological processes including epistatic interactions between incompatible loci, gametic selection, and meiotic drive. Examples of these phenomena have been identified in many species, implying that they are universal, but comprehensive species-wide studies of segregation distortion are lacking. We have performed a species-wide screen for distorted allele frequencies in over 500 segregating populations of Arabidopsis thaliana using reduced-representation genome sequencing. Biased transmission of alleles was evident in up to a quarter of surveyed populations. Most populations exhibited distortion at only one genomic region, with some regions being repeatedly affected in multiple populations. Our results begin to elucidate the species-level architecture of biased transmission of genetic material in A. thaliana, and serve as a springboard for future studies into the basis of intraspecific genetic barriers.},

Automated methods capable of accurately and reliably distinguishing between pathogenic and functionally neutral nsSNPs are therefore assuming ever?increasing importance. Here, we describe the Functional Analysis Through Hidden Markov Models (FATHMM) software and server: a species?independent method with optional species?specific weightings for the prediction of the functional effects of protein missense variants. Using a model weighted for human mutations, we obtained performance accuracies that outperformed traditional prediction methods (i.e., SIFT, PolyPhen, and PANTHER) on two separate benchmarks. Furthermore, in one benchmark, we achieve performance accuracies that outperform current state?of?the?art prediction methods (i.e., SNPs\&GO and MutPred). We demonstrate that FATHMM can be efficiently applied to high?throughput/large?scale human and nonhuman genome sequencing projects with the added benefit of phenotypic outcome associations. To illustrate this, we evaluated nsSNPs in wheat (Triticum spp.) to identify some of the important genetic variants responsible for the phenotypic differences introduced by intense selection during domestication. A Web?based implementation of FATHMM, including a high?throughput batch facility and a downloadable standalone package, is available at http://fathmm.biocompute.org.uk.},

Most of the genome size disparity is due to non-transcribed repeated DNA including retrotransposons and pseudogenes. Only a small fraction of the larger genomes such as those of many crop plants, contain genes. Genes are distributed unevenly along the chromosomes, often organized in clusters of varying sizes and gene-densities (gene-rich regions). The regions corresponding to gene-clusters in smaller genome plants such as rice may be divided into many `mini' gene-clusters in the related larger genomes. The range of gene-density within the `mini2019; gene-clusters is about the same among plants with varying genome sizes. Recombination per chromosome is similar among eukaryotes, and thus is considerably independent of DNA content and chromosome size. Relatively little recombination occurs outside the gene-rich regions. Recombination varies dramatically among various gene regions, and is highly uneven within gene regions as well. Consequently, a significant number of genes may be inaccessible to recombination-based manipulations such as map-based cloning.},

  abstract = {Echolocating bats behave as though they perceive the crosscorrelation functions between their sonar transmissions and echoes as images of targets, at least with respect to perception of target range, horizontal direction and shape. Bats apparently use a multi-dimensional acoustic imaging system for echolocation with broadband, usually FM signals. The perceptual structure of the echolocation signals used by different species of bats was investigated using the crosscorrelation functions between emitted signals and returning echoes as indices of perceptual acuity. The bandwidth and average period of echolocation signals are identified as the principal acoustic features of broadband sonar waveforms determining the quality of target perceptions. The multiple-harmonic structure of echolocation sounds, which is characteristic of the broadband signals of the majority of species of bats, yields a lower average period (separation of peaks in the crosscorrelation function) than expected from the average frequency of the signal sharpening target localization. FM of the harmonics in the sonar sounds of bats reduces the heights of side-peaks in the crosscorrelation functions of the signals, promoting sharp, unambiguous determination of target position and leads to the well-known coupling of perception of range and velocity for moving targets. The shapes of the frequency sweeps and bandwidths of FM contribute to reducing this range-velocity coupling. Harmonic organization nearly eliminates range-velocity coupling. The use of multiple-harmonics and fairly broad FM in sonar signals yields especially sharp resolution of target position to reject clutter interference. Such signals are commonly used by bats in cluttered environments. Very broad frequency sweeps with fewer harmonics may accomplish the same effect, but the low signal periodicity contributed by harmonic structure is an important factor in banishing side-peaks in the crosscorrelation function from perception.},

  abstract = {The Q gene is largely responsible for the widespread cultivation of wheat because it confers the free-threshing character. It also pleiotropically influences many other domestication-related traits such as glume shape and tenacity, rachis fragility, spike length, plant height, and spike emergence time. We isolated the Q gene and verified its identity by analysis of knockout mutants and transformation. The Q gene has a high degree of similarity to members of the AP2 family of transcription factors. The Q allele is more abundantly transcribed than q, and the two alleles differ for a single amino acid. An isoleucine at position 329 in the Q protein leads to an abundance of homodimer formation in yeast cells, whereas a valine in the q protein appears to limit homodimer formation. Ectopic expression analysis allowed us to observe both silencing and overexpression effects of Q. Rachis fragility, glume shape, and glume tenacity mimicked the q phenotype in transgenic plants exhibiting post-transcriptional silencing of the transgene and the endogenous Q gene. Variation in spike compactness and plant height were associated with the level of transgene transcription due to the dosage effects of Q. The q allele is the more primitive, and the mutation that gave rise to Q occurred only once leading to the world's cultivated wheats.},

Using parameter estimates from field data, the model predicted oscillations in morph frequency, and the frequencies of the three male morphs were found to oscillate over a six-year period in the field. The fitnesses of each morph relative to other morphs were non-transitive in that each morph could invade another morph when rare, but was itself invadable by another morph when common.

Here we report an integrated molecular linkage map of A genome diploid wheat based on 93 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from Triticum boeoticum \texttimes{} Triticum monococcum inter sub-specific cross. The parental lines were analysed with 306 simple sequence repeat (SSR) and 194 RFLP markers, including 66 bin mapped ESTs. Out of 306 SSRs tested for polymorphism, 74 (24.2\%) did not show amplification (null) in both the parents. Overall, 171 (73.7\%) of the 232 remaining SSR and 98 (50.5\%) of the 194 RFLP markers were polymorphic. Both A and D genome specific SSR markers showed similar transferability to A genome of diploid wheat species. The 176 polymorphic markers, that were assayed on a set of 93 RILs, yielded 188 polymorphic loci and 177 of these as well as two additional morphological traits mapped on seven linkage groups with a total map length of 1,262 cM, which is longer than most of the available A genome linkage maps in diploid and hexaploid wheat. About 58 loci showed distorted segregation with majority of these mapping on chromosome 2Am. With a few exceptions, the position and order of the markers was similar to the ones in other maps of the wheat A genome. Chromosome 1Am of T. monococcum and T. boeoticum showed a small paracentric inversion relative to the A genome of hexaploid wheat. The described linkage map could be useful for gene tagging, marker assisted gene introgression from diploid into hexaploid wheat as well as for map based cloning of genes from diploid A genome species and orthologous genes from hexaploid wheat.},

Three small larvae, 4.2 to 5.9 mm long, from euphasiids resembled L3 in anterior but not in posterior morphology; their tails lacked a mucron but, in two of them, cuticular separation at the posterior extremity revealed clearly the mucron characteristic of L3 within. These small larvae are identified as L2 of A. simplex in the process of moulting to L3. Japanese reports of typical L3 from 6.9 to 32.7 mm long in euphausiids, the occurrence in teleosts of typical L3 from only 8.8 to over 30 mm long, and the present observations strongly suggest that the moult from L2 to L3 occurs in euphausiids and begins when the larvae are about 4-6 mm long. Although it appears, therefore, that only one moult occurs in the egg of A. simplex (i.e. ensheathed L2 hatches), two moults there have been reported for various terrestrial and certain aquatic ascaridoids (i.e. ensheathed L3 hatches). The morphology and homology of the lips and associated sense organs of A simplex L3 are discussed relative to that of a 'typical' adult ascaridoid. A main conclusion is that euphausiids in the North-East Atlantic and northern North Sea, and perhaps universally, are major intermediate hosts of A simplex. The status as hosts of squid and teleosts harbouring L3 is discussed. An extensive literature is reviewed in relation to the present observations.},

  abstract = {Early wheat movement into Britain The transition into the New Stone Age, or Neolithic period, in Great Britain and Europe was characterized by a change from hunter-gatherers to farmers. However, the early stages of this transition are not well understood. Smith et al. studied archaeological remains at an 8000-year-old site that has been underwater ever since the Neolithic (see the Perspective by Larson). The finds include evidence of wheat (or a relative of wheat) 2000 years before the first documented farmers in Britain. It seems that trade may have preceded the adoption of farming. Science, this issue p. 998; see also p. 945 The Mesolithic-to-Neolithic transition marked the time when a hunter-gatherer economy gave way to agriculture, coinciding with rising sea levels. Bouldnor Cliff, is a submarine archaeological site off the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom that has a well-preserved Mesolithic paleosol dated to 8000 years before the present. We analyzed a core obtained from sealed sediments, combining evidence from microgeomorphology and microfossils with sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) analyses to reconstruct floral and faunal changes during the occupation of this site, before it was submerged. In agreement with palynological analyses, the sedaDNA sequences suggest a mixed habitat of oak forest and herbaceous plants. However, they also provide evidence of wheat 2000 years earlier than mainland Britain and 400 years earlier than proximate European sites. These results suggest that sophisticated social networks linked the Neolithic front in southern Europe to the Mesolithic peoples of northern Europe. Wheat was being consumed in Britain 2000 years earlier than expected. [Also see Perspective by Larson] Wheat was being consumed in Britain 2000 years earlier than expected.

Furthermore, as several authors have pointed out recently, linear molecular clocks that incorporate selectable characters are in any case problematic. We here confirm a modest effect of purifying selection on the mtDNA coding region and propose an improved molecular clock for dating human mtDNA, based on a worldwide phylogeny of {$>$} 2000 complete mtDNA genomes and calibrating against recent evidence for the divergence time of humans and chimpanzees. We focus on a time-dependent mutation rate based on the entire mtDNA genome and supported by a neutral clock based on synonymous mutations alone. We show that the corrected rate is further corroborated by archaeological dating for the settlement of the Canary Islands and Remote Oceania and also, given certain phylogeographic assumptions, by the timing of the first modern human settlement of Europe and resettlement after the Last Glacial Maximum. The corrected rate yields an age of modern human expansion in the Americas at approximately 15 kya that-unlike the uncorrected clock-matches the archaeological evidence, but continues to indicate an out-of-Africa dispersal at around 55-70 kya, 5-20 ky before any clear archaeological record, suggesting the need for archaeological research efforts focusing on this time window. We also present improved rates for the mtDNA control region, and the first comprehensive estimates of positional mutation rates for human mtDNA, which are essential for defining mutation models in phylogenetic analyses.},

A particularly intriguing question is why individuals in some species have been selected to migrate, whereas in other species they have been selected to be sedentary. In this paper, we suggest that this diverging selection might partially result from differences among species in the behavioural flexibility of their responses to seasonal changes in the environment. This hypothesis is supported in a comparative analysis of Palaearctic passerines. First, resident species tend to rely more on innovative feeding behaviours in winter, when food is harder to find, than in other seasons. Second, species with larger brains, relative to their body size, and a higher propensity for innovative behaviours tend to be resident, while less flexible species tend to be migratory. Residence also appears to be less likely in species that occur in more northerly regions, exploit temporally available food sources, inhabit non-buffered habitats and have smaller bodies. Yet, the role of behavioural flexibility as a response to seasonal environments is largely independent of these other factors. Therefore, species with greater foraging flexibility seem to be able to cope with seasonal environments better, while less flexible species are forced to become migratory.},

Using a global database documenting the outcome of more than 400 introduction events, we show that mammal species with larger brains, relative to their body mass, tend to be more successful than species with smaller brains at establishing themselves when introduced to novel environments, when both taxonomic and regional autocorrelations are accounted for. This finding is robust to the effect of other factors known to influence establishment success, including introduction effort and habitat generalism.

Here, we report that in passerine birds, migratory species tend to have brains that are substantially smaller (relative to body size) than those of resident species, confirming and generalizing previous studies. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on Bayesian Markov chain methods suggest an evolutionary scenario in which some large brained tropical passerines that invaded more seasonal regions evolved migratory behavior and migration itself selected for smaller brain size. Selection for smaller brains in migratory birds may arise from the energetic and developmental costs associated with a highly mobile life cycle, a possibility that is supported by a path analysis. Nevertheless, an important fraction (over 68\%) of the correlation between brain mass and migratory distance comes from a direct effect of migration on brain size, perhaps reflecting costs associated with cognitive functions that have become less necessary in migratory species. Overall, our results highlight the importance of retrospective analyses in identifying selective pressures that have shaped brain evolution, and indicate that when it comes to the brain, larger is not always better.},

  abstract = {Threshability is an important crop domestication trait. The wild wheat progenitors have tough glumes enveloping the floret that make spikes difficult to thresh, whereas cultivated wheats have soft glumes and are free-threshing. In hexaploid wheat, the glume tenacity gene Tg along with the major domestication locus Q control threshability. The Q gene was isolated recently and found to be a member of the AP2 class of transcription factors. However, only a few studies have reported on the tough glume trait. Here, we report comparative mapping of the soft glume (sog) gene of diploid Triticum monococcum L. and tenacious glume (Tg) gene of hexaploid T. aestivum L. using chromosome-specific SSR and RFLP markers. The sog gene was flanked by Xgwm71 and Xbcd120 in a 6.8~cM interval on chromosome 2AmS of T. monococcum whereas Tg was targeted to a 8.1~cM interval flanked by Xwmc503 and Xfba88 on chromosome 2DS of T. aestivum. Deletion bin mapping of the flanking markers assigned sog close to the centromere on 2AS, whereas Tg was mapped to the most distal region on 2DS. Both 2AS and 2DS maps were colinear ruling out the role of chromosome rearrangements for their non-syntenic positions. Therefore, sog and Tg are not true orthologues suggesting the possibility of a diverse origin.},

  abstract = {Sexual reproduction relies on the recognition of conspecifics for breeding. Most experiments in birds have implicated a critical role for early social learning in directing subsequent courtship behaviours and mating decisions. This classical view of avian sexual imprinting is challenged, however, by studies of megapodes and obligate brood parasites, species in which reliable recognition is achieved despite the lack of early experience with conspecifics. By rearing males with either conspecific or heterospecific brood mates, we experimentally tested the effect of early social experience on the association preferences and courtship behaviours of two sympatrically breeding ducks. We predicted that redheads (Aythya americana), which are facultative interspecific brood parasites, would show a diminished effect of early social environment on subsequent courtship preferences when compared with their host and congener, the canvasback (Aythya valisineria). Contrary to expectations, cross-fostered males of both species courted heterospecific females and preferred them in spatial association tests, whereas control males courted and associated with conspecific females. These results imply that ontogenetic constraints on species recognition may be a general impediment to the initial evolution of interspecific brood parasitism in birds. Under more natural conditions, a variety of mechanisms may mitigate or counteract the effects of early imprinting for redheads reared in canvasback broods.},

New and optimized thresholds for PZQ tablet administration at one tablet (600. mg), 3/4 and 1/2 tablet divisions are suggested here. Both dose poles investigated estimated an acceptable PZQ dosage (30-60. mg/Kg) for more than 95\% of children. Extension and optimization of the current PZQ dose pole, followed by theoretical validation using biometric data from preschool-aged children (0-6 years of age, 60-110. cm in height) from 36 African countries will help future mass drug administration campaigns incorporate younger children. This newly optimized dose pole with single 600. mg (height: 99-110. cm), 3/4 (height: 83-99. cm) and 1/2 (height: 66-83. cm) tablet divisions, also reduces drug waste and facilitates inclusion of preschool-aged children.

Divergence times of living species, estimated from molecular clocks, have the potential to constrain hypotheses of the relationships of fossil species. In this study, new DNA sequences from nine protein-coding nuclear genes in great apes are added to existing datasets to increase the precision of molecular time estimates bearing on the evolutionary history of apes and humans. The divergence of Old World monkeys and hominoids at the Oligocene-Miocene boundary (approximately 23 million years ago) provides the best primate calibration point and yields a time and 95\% confidence interval of 5.4 +/- 1.1 million years ago (36 nuclear genes) for the human-chimpanzee divergence. Older splitting events are estimated as 6.4 +/- 1.5 million years ago (gorilla, 31 genes), 11.3 +/- 1.3 million years ago (orangutan, 33 genes), and 14.9 +/- 2.0 million years ago (gibbon, 27 genes).

Surprisingly, within the 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic tree, hyperthermophiles occupy all the shortest and deepest branches closest to the root. Therefore, they appear to be the most primitive extant organisms. Most of them (the primary producers) are able to grow chemolithoautotrophically, using CO2 as sole carbon source and inorganic energy sources, suggesting a hyperthermophilic autotrophic common ancestor. They gain energy from various kinds of respiration. Molecular hydrogen and reduced sulfur compounds serve as electron donors while CO2, oxidized sulfur compounds, NO3- and O2 (only rarely) serve as electron acceptors. Growth demands of hyperthermophiles fit the scenario of a hot volcanism-dominated primitive Earth. Similar anaerobic chemolithoautotrophic hyperthermophiles, completely independent of a sun, could even exist on other planets provided that active volcanism and liquid water were present.},

  abstract = {Characters which are closely linked to fitness often have low heritabilities (VA/ VP). Low heritabilities could be because of low additive genetic variation (VA), that had been depleted by directional selection. Alternatively, low heritabil- ities may be caused by large residual variation (VR {$\frac{1}{4}$} VP \textendash{} VA) compounded at a disproportionately higher rate than VA across integrated characters. Both hypotheses assume that each component of quantitative variation has an independent effect on heritability. However, VA and VR may also covary, in which case differences in heritability cannot be fully explained by the independent effects of elimination-selection or compounded residual vari- ation. We compared the central tendency of published behavioural heritabilities (mean {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.31, median {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.23) with morphological and life history data collected by Mousseau \& Roff (1987). Average behavioural heritability was not significantly different from average life history heritability, but both were smaller than average morphological heritability. We cross-classified beha- vioural traits to test whether variation in heritability was related to selection (dominance, domestic/wild) or variance compounding (integration level). There was a significant three-way interaction between indices of selection and variance compounding, related to the absence of either effect at the highest integration level. At lower integration levels, high dominance variance indicated effects of selection. It was also indicated by the low CVA of domestic species. At the same time CVR increased disproportionately faster than CVA across integration levels, demonstrating variance compounding. However, neither CVR nor CVA had a predominant effect on heritability. The partial regression coefficients of CVR and CVA on heritability were similar and a path analysis indicated that their (positive) correlation was also necessary to explain variation in heritability. These results suggest that relationships between additive genetic and residual components of quantitative genetic variation can constrain their independent direct effects on behavioural heritability.

This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

These samples were fixed in either 3\% glutaraldehyde or RNAlater\texttrademark{} or frozen at -25\textdegree C for subsequent analysis. In addition, leaf samples were collected from 24- and 14-day-old plants during the mission that were returned to Earth for analysis. Plants grown under identical light, temperature, relative humidity, photoperiod, CO2, and planting density were used as ground controls. At the morphological level, there was little difference in the development of cells of wheat under {$\mu$}g conditions. Leaves developed in {$\mu$}g have thinner cross-sectional area than the 1 g grown plants. Ultrastructurally, the chloroplasts of {$\mu$}g grown plants were more ovoid than those developed at 1 g, and the thylakoid membranes had a trend to greater packing density. No differences were observed in the starch, soluble sugar, or lignin content of the leaves grown in {$\mu$}g or 1 g conditions. Furthermore, no differences in gene expression were detected leaf samples collected at {$\mu$}g from 24-day-old leaves, suggesting that the spaceflight environment had minimal impact on wheat metabolism.},

The effects of extended exposure to microgravity on the development and functioning of photosynthesis at the leaf and stand levels were examined onboard the International Space Station (ISS). The PESTO (Photosynthesis Experiment Systems Testing and Operations) experiment was the first long-term replicated test to obtain direct measurements of canopy photosynthesis from space under well-controlled conditions. The PESTO experiment consisted of a series of 21\textendash 24 day growth cycles of Triticum aestivum L. cv. USU Apogee onboard ISS. Single leaf measurements showed no differences in photosynthetic activity at the moderate (up to 600 {$\mu$}mol m-2 s-1) light levels, but reductions in whole chain electron transport, PSII, and PSI activities were measured under saturating light ({$>$}2,000 {$\mu$}mol m-2 s-1) and CO2 (4000 {$\mu$}mol mol-1) conditions in the microgravity-grown plants. Canopy level photosynthetic rates of plants developing in microgravity at {$\sim$}280 {$\mu$}mol m-2 s-1 were not different from ground controls. The wheat canopy had apparently adapted to the microgravity environment since the CO2 compensation (121 vs. 118 {$\mu$}mol mol-1) and PPF compensation (85 vs. 81 {$\mu$}mol m-2 s-1) of the flight and ground treatments were similar. The reduction in whole chain electron transport (13\%), PSII (13\%), and PSI (16\%) activities observed under saturating light conditions suggests that microgravity-induced responses at the canopy level may occur at higher PPF intensity.},

To maximize utility, the simulation tool must be based on effective models of the genome, the breeding process, and other `processes' involved in genetic recombination, identification, and production of new cultivars. Additionally, the statistical methodology employed has ramifications for predicting performance and breeding outcome. The objective of this work is to highlight the role of computer simulation in the planning phases of crop genetic improvement, the basics of model building, statistical considerations, and key issues to be addressed.

Electroreception in air, a nonconductive medium, is a recently discovered sensory capacity of insects, yet the sensory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigate two putative electric field sensors: antennae and mechanosensory hairs. Examining their mechanical and neural response, we show that electric fields cause deflections in both antennae and hairs. Hairs respond with a greater median velocity, displacement, and angular displacement than antennae. Extracellular recordings from the antennae do not show any electrophysiological correlates to these mechanical deflections. In contrast, hair deflections in response to an electric field elicited neural activity. Mechanical deflections of both hairs and antennae increase with the electric charge carried by the bumblebee. From this evidence, we conclude that sensory hairs are a site of electroreception in the bumblebee.},

Mapping of molecular markers using monoploids is greatly facilitated by the simple 1:1 segregation ratio expected from all heterozygous loci in the genome. Distorted segregation of molecular markers, however, appears to be a common phenomenon in many crop species and hinders the use of monoploids for mapping purposes. This report examines the segregation pattern of two marker genes linked together with one locus or separately with two independent loci which are responsible for the observed distortion. Each of the loci exhibiting distorted segregation has one of the two alleles which inhibits regeneration of the gametic cells in vitro and disrupts the expected segregation ratio of the linked markers. All possible situations in which linkage occurs between markers and distortion-causing genes are considered. Theoretical results outlining the segregation pattern among these linkage types indicate that the distinguishable distorted ratios can be used for mapping purposes. A protocol is given for the mapping of distorted gene markers based on existing gene mapping software. An example is presented of the mapping of distorted RAPD markers of monoploids obtained from a diploid potato genotype.},

Recent reports in higher plants have demonstrated that hybrid sterility results in segregation distortion at the causal gene regions in progeny of intraspecific crosses. Ne1 and Ne2 complementary loci are known to control hybrid necrosis in intraspecific crosses of common wheat cultivars. Here, we examine the effect of a weak necrosis allele Ne1 w on the segregation ratio of molecular markers in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of common wheat. Some RILs showed accelerated cell death in the leaves at the heading stage due to the epistatic interaction between two quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 5B and 2B. Chromosomal localization of these QTL corresponding to Ne1 w and Ne2 showed distorted segregation ratios of assigned markers having oppositely biased direction. Although the Ne1 w and Ne2 interaction had no obvious effect on seed fertility, Ne1 w reduced completion of grain development under the Ne2-homozygous background. This reduction might be one of causes that induces segregation distortion in the 5B and 2B chromosomal regions of RILs. The present study demonstrated that weak hybrid necrosis has limited phenotypic effects; it causes segregation distortion in progeny from intraspecific crosses.},

  abstract = {QTL (quantitative trait loci) mapping is commonly used to identify genetic regions responsible to important phenotype variation. A common strategy of QTL mapping is to use recombinant inbred lines (RILs), which are usually established by several generations of inbreeding of an F1 population (usually up to F6 or F7 populations). As this inbreeding process involves a large amount of labor, we are particularly interested in the effect of the number of inbreeding generations on the power of QTL mapping; a part of the labor could be saved if a smaller number of inbreeding provides sufficient power. By using simulations, we investigated the performance of QTL mapping with recombinant inbred lines (RILs). As expected, we found that the power of F4 population could be almost comparable to that of F6 and F7 populations. A potential problem in using F4 population is that a large proportion of RILs are heterozygotes. We here introduced a new method to partly relax this problem. The performance of this method was verified by simulations with a wide range of parameters including the size of the segregation population, recombination rate, genome size and the density of markers. We found our method works better than the commonly used standard method especially when there are a number of heterozygous markers. Our results imply that in most cases, QTL mapping does not necessarily require RILs at F6 or F7 generations; rather, F4 (or even F3) populations would be almost as useful as F6 or F7 populations. Because the cost to establish a number of RILs for many generations is enormous, this finding will cause a reduction in the cost of QTL mapping, thereby accelerating gene mapping in many species.},

As the two maps are based on a common set of probes, it was possible to determine, with a high degree of precision, the breakpoints corresponding to 5 chromosomal inversions that differentiate the tomato and potato genomes. All of the inversions appear to have resulted from single breakpoints at or near the centromeres of the affected chromosomes, the result being the inversion of entire chromosome arms. While the crossing over rate among chromosomes appears to be uniformly distributed with respect to chromosome size, there is tremendous heterogeneity of crossing over within chromosomes. Regions of the map corresponding to centromeres and centromeric heterochromatin, and in some instances telomeres, experience up to 10-fold less recombination than other areas of the genome. Overall, 28\% of the mapped loci reside in areas of putatively suppressed recombination. This includes loci corresponding to both random, single copy genomic clones and transcribed genes (detected with cDNA probes). The extreme heterogeneity of crossing over within chromosomes has both practical and evolutionary implications. Currently tomato and potato are among the most thoroughly mapped eukaryotic species and the availability of high density molecular linkage maps should facilitate chromosome walking, quantitative trait mapping, marker-assisted breeding and evolutionary studies in these two important and well studied crop species.},

The frogs, however, run the risk of intoxicating themselves. Studying the frog neurotoxin epibatidine, which binds to acetylcholine receptors, Tarvin et al. found a single amino acid substitution. The substitution changes the configuration of the acetylcholine receptor, so that it decreases its sensitivity to the toxin. But acetylcholine signaling is essential for normal life. Expressing poison frog and human receptors in frog eggs revealed that different amino acid substitutions have occurred in different lineages that allow the frog to resist its own toxins while still letting target neurotransmitters function effectively. Science, this issue p. 1261 Animals that wield toxins face self-intoxication. Poison frogs have a diverse arsenal of defensive alkaloids that target the nervous system. Among them is epibatidine, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist that is lethal at microgram doses. Epibatidine shares a highly conserved binding site with acetylcholine, making it difficult to evolve resistance yet maintain nAChR function. Electrophysiological assays of human and frog nAChR revealed that one amino acid replacement, which evolved three times in poison frogs, decreased epibatidine sensitivity but at a cost of acetylcholine sensitivity. However, receptor functionality was rescued by additional amino acid replacements that differed among poison frog lineages. Our results demonstrate how resistance to agonist toxins can evolve and that such genetic changes propel organisms toward an adaptive peak of chemical defense. Poison frogs have evolved mutations in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor genes that confer toxin resistance.

  abstract = {Segregation distortion is increasingly recognized as a potentially powerful evolutionary force. This runs counter to the perception that non-Mendelian genes are rare genetic curiosities, a view that seems to be supported by the near ubiquity of the Mendelian system of inheritance. There are several reasons why segregation distortion may be more important than is evidenced by known empirical examples. One possibility is that the types of segregation distorters we have found are only a subset of a broader range of non-Mendelian systems, many of which go undetected. In this paper, we review what is known about the sex-linked meiotic drive system in the plant, Silene latifolia, and present some data on the mechanism of segregation distortion. We outline the general features that segregation distorters in plants and animals have in common. In some cases, such as the paucity of systems that directly alter meiotic segregation, there are likely to be inherent constraints on the range of systems that can possibly occur. Other generalities, however, support the notion that many forms of meiotic drive are possible, and that the known examples of segregation distortion are likely to be only subset of those that can possibly occur. Non-Mendelian genes may therefore have greater evolutionary importance than their current abundance in nature would suggest.},

Here, we report on the first experimental study to our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the acquisition of tool-use in a bird species. The woodpecker finch Cactospiza pallida, endemic to the Gal\'apagos Islands, is a famous textbook example of tool-use in animals. This species uses modified twigs or cactus spines to pry arthropods out of tree holes. Using nestlings and adult birds from the field, we tested experimentally whether woodpecker finches learn tool-use socially. We show that social learning is not essential for the development of tool-use: all juveniles developed tool-use regardless of whether or not they had a tool-using model. However, we found that not all adult woodpecker finches used tools in our experiments. These non-tool-using individuals also did not learn this task by observing tool-using conspecifics. Our results suggest that tool-use behaviour depends on a very specific learning disposition that involves trial-and-error learning during a sensitive phase early in ontogeny.},

For each locus, we sequenced a common sample of 25 individuals representing 16 exotic landraces and nine U.S. inbred lines. The data indicated that maize has an average of one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) every 104 bp between two randomly sampled sequences, a level of diversity higher than that of either humans or Drosophila melanogaster. A comparison of genetic diversity between the landrace and inbred samples showed that inbreds retained 77\% of the level of diversity of landraces, on average. In addition, Tajima's D values suggest that the frequency distribution of polymorphisms in inbreds was skewed toward fewer rare variants. Tests for selection were applied to all loci, and deviations from neutrality were detected in three loci. Sequence diversity was heterogeneous among loci, but there was no pattern of diversity along the genetic map of chromosome 1. Nonetheless, diversity was correlated (r = 0.65) with sequence-based estimates of the recombination rate. Recombination in our sample was sufficient to break down linkage disequilibrium among SNPs. Intragenic linkage disequilibrium declines within 100\textendash 200 bp on average, suggesting that genome-wide surveys for association analyses require SNPs every 100\textendash 200 bp.},

Human culture, in contrast, has the distinctive characteristic that it accumulates modifications over time (what we call the 'ratchet effect'). This difference results from the facts that (i) human social learning is more oriented towards process than product and (ii) unique forms of human cooperation lead to active teaching, social motivations for conformity and normative sanctions against non-conformity. Together, these unique processes of social learning and cooperation lead to humans' unique form of cumulative cultural evolution.},

Significant deviations from the expected Mendelian ratios were observed for four of the ten markers studied in the cross. Distorted ratios were associated with loci located on chromosomes 4H and 6H. The differential transmission of alleles was in favour of the responsive parent (Blenheim) used in the anther culture studies. For the {$\alpha$}-Amy-1 locus on chromosome 6H, the preferential transmission of Blenheim alleles was most pronounced in the haploid regenerants that were colchicine treated. These results are discussed in relation to the genetic control of androgenetic response in barley and with respect to the exploitation of another culture in barley improvement.},

Group territories overlapped and, in many cases, the same sleeping burrows were used by different groups. Differences persisted even after accounting for effects of group size, weather and burrow characteristics, and were unrelated to food availability within territories.

Hierbei habe ich vielleicht das Arbeitsgebiet der Ethologie weiter gefa\textbackslash s st, als unter Ethologen gebr\"auchlich ist. Wenn man aber die vielartige Arbeit jener Forscher \"ubersieht, die sich Ethologen nennen, ist man zu dieser weiten Fassung geradezu gezwungen. Ich habe in meiner Darstellung weder Vollst\"andigkeit noch Gleichgewicht angestrebt und, um zur Fortf\"uhrung des Gespr\"achs anzuregen, ruhig meine Steckenpferde geritten, vor allem das Verh\"altnis zwischen Ethologie und Physiologie, die Gefahr der Vernachl\"assigung der Frage der Arterhaltung, Fragen der Methodik der ontogenetischen Forschung, und Aufgaben und Methoden der Evolutionsforschung. Bei der Einsch\"atzung des Anteils, den Lorenz an der Entwicklung der Ethologie genommen hat und noch nimmt, habe ich als seinen Hauptbeitrag den bezeichnet, da\textbackslash s s er uns gezeigt hat, wie man bew\"ahrtes biologisches Denken folgerichtig auf Verhalten anwenden kann. Da\textbackslash s s er dabei an die Arbeit seiner Vorg\"anger angekn\"upft hat, ist nicht mehr verwunderlich, als da\textbackslash s s jeder Vater selbst einen Vater hat. Insbesondere scheint mir das Wesentliche an Lorenz Arbeit zu sein, da\textbackslash s s er klar gesehen hat, da\textbackslash s s Verhaltensweisen Teile von Organen, von Systemen der Arterhaltung sind; da\textbackslash s s ihre Verursachung genau so exakt untersucht werden kann wie die gleich welcher anderer Lebensvorg\"ange, da\textbackslash s s ihr arterhaltender Wert ebenso systematisch und exakt aufweisbar ist wie ihre Verursachung, da\textbackslash s s Verhaltensontogenie in grunds\"atzlich gleicher Weise erforscht werden kann wie die Ontogenie der Form und da\textbackslash s s die Erforschung der Verhaltensevolution der Untersuchung der Strukturevolution parallel geht. Und obwohl Lorenz ein riesiges Tatsachenmaterial gesammelt hat, ist die Ethologie doch noch mehr durch seine Fragestellung und durch k\"uhne Hypothesen gef\"ordert als durch eigene Nachpr\"ufung dieser Hypothesen.

Selbstverst\"andlich ist diese synthetische Entwicklung nicht die Arbeit eines Mannes oder gar die der Ethologen.

  abstract = {A new hypothesis about the role of focused attention is proposed. The feature-integration theory of attention suggests that attention must be directed serially to each stimulus in a display whenever conjunctions of more than one separable feature are needed to characterize or distinguish the possible objects presented. A number of predictions were tested in a variety of paradigms includ-ing visual search, texture segregation, identification and localization, and using both separable dimensions (shape and color) and local elements or parts of figures (lines, curves, etc. in letters) as the features to be integrated into complex wholes. The results were in general consistent with the hypothesis. They offer a new set of criteria for distinguishing separable from integral features and a new rationale for predicting which tasks will show attention limits and which will not. When we open our eyes on a familiar scene, we form an immediate impression of recognizable objects, organized coherently in a spatial framework. Analysis of our experience into more elementary sensations is difficult, and appears subjectively to require an unusual type of per-ceptual activity. In contrast, the physiological evidence suggests that the visual scene is analyzed at an early stage by specialized populations of receptors that respond selectively to such properties as orientation, color, spatial frequency, or movement, and map these properties in different areas of the brain (Zeki, 1976). The controversy between analytic and synthetic theories of perception goes back many years: the As-sociationists asserted that the experience of complex wholes is built by combining more elementary sensations, while the Gestalt psychologists claimed that the whole precedes its parts, that we initially register unitary objects and relationships, and only later, if necessary, analyze these ob-jects into their component parts or properties. This view is still active now},

However, the potential of silicon nanoparticle (SiNP) in regulating abiotic stress and associated mechanisms have not yet been explored. Therefore, in the present study hydroponic experiments were conducted to investigate whether Si or SiNp are more effective in the regulation of UV-B stress. UV-B (ambient and enhanced) radiation caused adverse effect on growth of wheat (Triticum aestivum) seedlings, which was accompanied by declined photosynthetic performance and altered vital leaf structures. Levels of superoxide radical and H2O2 were enhanced by UV-B as also evident from their histochemical stainings, which was accompanied by increased lipid peroxidation (LPO) and electrolyte leakage. Activities of superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase were inhibited by UV-B while catalase and guaiacol peroxidase, and all non-enzymatic antioxidants were stimulated by UV-B. Although, nitric oxide (NO) content was increased at all tested combinations, but its maximum content was observed under SiNps together with UV-B enhanced treatment. Pre-additions of SiNp as well as Si protected wheat seedlings against UV-B by regulating oxidative stress through enhanced antioxidants. Data indicate that SiNp might have protected wheat seedlings through NO-mediated triggering of antioxidant defense system, which subsequently counterbalance reactive oxygen species-induced damage to photosynthesis. Further, SiNp appear to be more effective in reducing UV-B stress than Si, which is related to its greater availability to wheat seedlings.},

This review presents breeding progress in wheat for yield gains using agronomic and physiological traits. Further, the paper discusses globally available wheat genetic resources to identify and select promising genotypes possessing useful agronomic and physiological traits to enhance water, nutrient- and radiation-use efficiency to improve grain yield potential and tolerance to abiotic stresses (i.e. elevated CO2, high temperature and drought stresses).

  abstract = {Most quantitative traits in most populations exhibit heritable genetic variation. Lande proposed that high levels of heritable variation may be maintained by mutation in the face of stabilizing selection. Several analyses have appeared of two distinct models with n additive polygenic loci subject to mutation and stabilizing selection. Each is reviewed and a new analysis and model are presented. Lande and Fleming analyzed extensions of a model originally treated by Kimura which assumes a continuum of possible allelic effects at each locus. Latter and Bulmer analyzed a model with diallelic loci. The published analyses of these models lead to qualitatively different predictions concerning the dependence of the equilibrium genetic variance on the underlying biological parameters. A new asymptotic analysis of the Kimura model shows that the different predictions are not consequences of the number of alleles assumed but rather are attributable to assumptions concerning the relative magnitudes of per locus mutation rates, the phenotypic effects of mutation, and the intensity of selection. This conclusion is reinforced by analysis of a model with triallelic loci. None of the approximate analyses presented are mathematically rigorous. To quantify their accuracy and display the domains of validity for alternative approximations, numerically determined equilibria are presented. In addition, empirical estimates of mutation rates and selection intensity are reviewed, revealing weaknesses in both the data and its connection to the models. Although the mathematical results and underlying biological requirements of my analyses are quite different from those of Lande, the results do not refute his hypothesis that considerable additive genetic variance may be maintained by mutation-selection balance. However, I argue that the validity of this hypothesis can only be determined with additional data and mathematics.},

These mutant collections, together with genome editing, are being used in polyploid species to combine mutations in all copies of a gene (homoeologs), and to expose phenotypic variation that was previously hidden by functional redundancy among homoeologs. This redundancy is more extensive in recently formed polyploids such as wheat, which can now benefit from the deployment of useful recessive mutations previously identified in its diploid relatives. Sequenced mutant populations and genome editing have changed the paradigm of what is possible in functional genetic analysis of wheat.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims Diversity of the genus Sorbus has been affected by interspecific hybridizations. Pink-flowered hybrid species have been insufficiently studied so far. They comprise bigenomic hybrid species derived from crosses S. aria s.l. \texttimes{} S. chamaemespilus and trigenomic ones, where S. aucuparia was involved as well. The main objective of the present study was to reconstruct their hybrid origins as well as to assess genetic distinction among several morphologically recognized hybrid species.Methods Samples from putative maternal species and eight pink-flowered and two white-flowered hybrid species were collected in the Western Carpathians and the Sudetes. In total, 370 specimens were analysed. Six chloroplast microsatellites were used to infer parentage, whereas nuclear amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers were employed for the identification of clones and patterns of genetic variation. Ploidy levels were estimated by flow cytometry on a subset of 140 individuals.Key Results Genetic data supported their hybrid origins proposed based on flower and leaf morphology, and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) revealed recurrent origins (S. caeruleomontana, S. haljamovae), even from bidirectional hybridization events (S. zuzanae). All bigenomic and trigenomic hybrid species (except triploid S. zuzanae) were found to be tetraploid. In addition to polyploidy, low genetic variation and the presence of clones within and among populations were observed, suggesting predominantly apomictic reproduction of the hybrid species. Most of the described hybrid species appeared also genetically distinct.Conclusions The data suggest that multiple hybridization events in the Western Carpathian Sorbus have led to the formation of separate, partially reproductively isolated genetic lineages, which may or may not be discriminated morphologically. Even bidirectional hybridization can produce individuals classified to the same taxon based on phenotype. For some hybrid taxa, hybridization pathways were proposed based on their genetic proximity to parental species and differences in genome sizes.},

For example, as competitive ability is sensitive to parameters including reproductive rate, carrying capacity and competition efficiency, the outcome of interspecific competition may be influenced by any process that alters these attributes. Although several such scenarios have been discussed, the influence of selfish genetic elements within one species on competition between species has not received theoretical treatment. We show that, with strong competition, sex-ratio meiotic drive systems can result in a significant shift in community composition because the effective birth rate in the population may be increased by a female-biased sex ratio. Using empirical data, we attempt to estimate the magnitude of this effect in several Drosophila species. We infer that meiotic drive elements, selfish genetic elements within species, can provide a substantial competitive advantage to that species within a community.},

It is thought, however, that the nucleotides constituting RNA were scarce on early Earth. RNA-based life must therefore have acquired the ability to synthesize RNA nucleotides from simpler and more readily available precursors, such as sugars and bases. Plausible prebiotic synthesis routes have been proposed for sugars, sugar phosphates and the four RNA bases, but the coupling of these molecules into nucleotides, specifically pyrimidine nucleotides, poses a challenge to the RNA world hypothesis. Here we report the application of in vitro selection to isolate RNA molecules that catalyse the synthesis of a pyrimidine nucleotide at their 3' terminus. The finding that RNA can catalyse this type of reaction, which is modelled after pyrimidine synthesis in contemporary metabolism, supports the idea of an RNA world that included nucleotide synthesis and other metabolic pathways mediated by ribozymes.},

We investigated how nine-spined sticklebacks use conflicting public and private information of variable reliability to make foraging decisions. In a first experiment, when private information was reliable, sticklebacks ignored public information and based their foraging decision on private information. However, when private information was less reliable, sticklebacks tended to use public rather than private information. A second experiment investigated how the time since experiencing private information affected sticklebacks' use of this information when it conflicted with recent public information. Fish based their foraging decisions on recently acquired private information, but reliance on private information diminished as the period since experiencing it increased. Fish used public information if 7 days had elapsed since updating their private information. Our findings suggest that nine-spined sticklebacks flexibly adjust their decision making to exploit the most reliable information available, be it public or private, and that animals will weight private and public information appropriately depending on circumstances.},

  abstract = {Invertebrates have contributed greatly to our understanding of associative learning because they allow learning protocols to be combined with experimental access to the nervous system. The honeybee Apis mellifera constitutes a standard model for the study of appetitive learning and memory since it was shown, almost a century ago, that bees learn to associate different sensory cues with a reward of sugar solution. However, up to now, no study has explored aversive learning in bees in such a way that simultaneous access to its neural bases is granted. Using odorants paired with electric shocks, we conditioned the sting extension reflex, which is exhibited by harnessed bees when subjected to a noxious stimulation. We show that this response can be conditioned so that bees learn to extend their sting in response to the odorant previously punished. Bees also learn to extend the proboscis to one odorant paired with sugar solution and the sting to a different odorant paired with electric shock, thus showing that they can master both appetitive and aversive associations simultaneously. Responding to the appropriate odorant with the appropriate response is possible because two different biogenic amines, octopamine and dopamine subserve appetitive and aversive reinforcement, respectively. While octopamine has been previously shown to substitute for appetitive reinforcement, we demonstrate that blocking of dopaminergic, but not octopaminergic, receptors suppresses aversive learning. Therefore, aversive learning in honeybees can now be accessed both at the behavioral and neural levels, thus opening new research avenues for understanding basic mechanisms of learning and memory.},

  abstract = {Background The growing wealth of knowledge on whole-plant genome sequences is highlighting the key role of transposable elements (TEs) in plant evolution, as a driver of drastic changes in genome size and as a source of an important number of new coding and regulatory sequences. Together with polyploidization events, TEs should thus be considered the major players in evolution of plants.Scope This review outlines the major mechanisms by which TEs impact plant genome evolution and how polyploidy events can affect these impacts, and vice versa. These include direct effects on genes, by providing them with new coding or regulatory sequences, an effect on the epigenetic status of the chromatin close to genes, and more subtle effects by imposing diverse evolutionary constraints to different chromosomal regions. These effects are particularly relevant after polyploidization events. Polyploidization often induces bursts of transposition probably due to a relaxation in their epigenetic control, and, in the short term, this can increase the rate of gene mutations and changes in gene regulation due to the insertion of TEs next to or into genes. Over longer times, TE bursts may induce global changes in genome structure due to inter-element recombination including losses of large genome regions and chromosomal rearrangements that reduce the genome size and the chromosome number as part of a process called diploidization.Conclusions TEs play an essential role in genome and gene evolution, in particular after polyploidization events. Polyploidization can induce TE activity that may explain part of the new phenotypes observed. TEs may also play a role in the diploidization that follows polyploidization events. However, the extent to which TEs contribute to diploidization and fractionation bias remains unclear. Investigating the multiple factors controlling TE dynamics and the nature of ancient and recent polyploid genomes may shed light on these processes.},

In order to test which features of an object the fish use under these conditions to discriminate between differently shaped objects, we trained eight individuals in a food-rewarded, two-alternative, forced-choice procedure. All fish learned to discriminate between two objects of different shapes and volumes. When new object combinations were offered in non-rewarded test trials, fish preferred those objects that resembled the one they had been trained to (S+) and avoided objects resembling the one that had not been rewarded (S-). For a decision, fish paid attention to the relative differences between the two objects they had to discriminate. For discrimination, fish used several object features, the most important ones being volume, material and shape. The importance of shape was demonstrated by reducing the objects to their 3-dimensional contours, which sufficed for the fish to distinguish differently shaped objects. Our results also showed that fish attended strongly to the feature ;volume', because all individuals tended to avoid the larger one of two objects. When confronted with metal versus plastic objects, all fish avoided metal and preferred plastic objects, irrespective of training. In addition to volume, material and shape, fish attended to additional parameters, such as corners or rounded edges. When confronted with two unknown objects, fish weighed up the positive and negative properties of these novel objects and based their decision on the outcome of this comparison. Our results suggest that fish are able to link and assemble local features of an electrolocation pattern to construct a representation of an object, suggesting that some form of a feature extraction mechanism enables them to solve a complex object recognition task.},

Suspensions of intact chromosomes were prepared by mechanical homogenization of synchronized root tips after mild fixation with formaldehyde. Histograms of relative fluorescence intensity (flow karyotypes) obtained after the analysis of DAPI-stained chromosomes were characterized and the chromosome content of all peaks on wheat flow karyotype was determined for the first time. Only chromosome 3B could be discriminated on flow karyotypes of wheat lines with standard karyotype. Remaining chromosomes formed three composite peaks and could be sorted only as groups. Chromosome 3B could be sorted at purity {$>$}95\% as determined by microscopic evaluation of sorted fractions that were labeled using C-PRINS with primers for GAA microsatellites and for Afa repeats, respectively. Chromosome 5BL/7BL could be sorted in two wheat cultivars at similar purity, indicating a potential of various wheat stocks for sorting of other chromosome types. PCR with chromosome-specific primers confirmed the identity of sorted fractions and suitability of flow-sorted chromosomes for physical mapping and for construction of small-insert DNA libraries. Sorted chromosomes were also found suitable for the preparation of high-molecular-weight DNA. On the basis of these results, it seems realistic to propose construction of large-insert chromosome-specific DNA libraries in wheat. The availability of such libraries would greatly simplify the analysis of the complex wheat genome.},

  abstract = {Using demes from experimental metapopulations of the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, we investigated phase 3 of Wright's shifting balance process. Using parent demes of high, intermediate, and low mean fitness, we experimentally modeled migration of varying amounts from demes of high mean fitness into demes of lower mean fitness (like phase 3) as well as the reciprocal (the opposite of phase 3). In natural populations, some migration among demes occurs independently of deme fitness. In this case, demes of high mean fitness are likely to receive migrants from demes of lower mean fitness; these effects might limit the effectiveness of phase 3 but have not been studied experimentally. We estimated the populational heritability of mean fitness by the regression of offspring deme means on the weighted parental means and found moderate levels of demic heritability one (0.641-0.690) and two (0.518-0.552) generations after migration. We discuss our findings in relation to the role of interdemic migration in "adaptive peak shifts" in metapopulations and the controversies over group selection and the units of inheritance.},

The transduction of sensory signals alters the concentration of small phosphorylated response regulators that bind to the rotary flagellar motor and cause switching. This simple pathway has provided a paradigm for sensory systems in general. However, the increasing number of sequenced bacterial genomes shows that although the central sensory mechanism seems to be common to all bacteria, there is added complexity in a wide range of species.},

  abstract = {Advances in genomics have expedited~the improvement of several agriculturally important crops but similar efforts in wheat (Triticum spp.) have been more challenging. This is largely owing to the size and complexity of the wheat genome1, and the lack of genome-assembly data for multiple wheat lines2,3. Here we generated ten chromosome pseudomolecule and five scaffold assemblies of hexaploid wheat to explore the genomic diversity among wheat lines from global breeding programs. Comparative analysis revealed extensive structural rearrangements, introgressions from wild relatives and differences in gene content resulting from complex breeding histories aimed at improving adaptation to diverse environments, grain yield and quality, and resistance to stresses4,5. We provide examples outlining the utility of these genomes, including a detailed multi-genome-derived nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein repertoire involved in disease resistance and the characterization of Sm16, a gene associated with insect resistance. These genome assemblies will provide a basis for functional gene discovery and breeding to deliver the next generation of modern wheat cultivars.},

One population comprised 81 F2 individuals derived from a cross between maize inbred line B73 and Zea mays ssp parviglumis, while the second consisted of 63 backcross individuals from a cross of maize inbred line B73 with Z. mays ssp diploperennis. In the B73 x Z. mays ssp parviglumis F2 population, 172 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were mapped to 10 chromosomes, which covered 2210.8 cM. In the B73 x Z. mays ssp diploperennis backcross population, 258 SSR markers were mapped to 10 chromosomes, covering 1357.7 cM. Comparison of the two maps revealed that the total map length of Z. mays ssp diploperennis covers 1357.7 cM, which is about 61.4\% of that of Z. mays ssp parviglumis (2210.8 cM). Extensive segregation distortion regions were found on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 10 in the B73 x Z. mays ssp parviglumis F2 population and on chromosomes 1-5 and 8-10 in the B73 x Z. mays ssp parviglumis backcross population. Segregation distortion analysis confirmed that the segregation distortion ratio in the interspecific population B73 x Z. mays ssp diploperennis was higher than in B73 x Z. mays ssp parviglumis. We found that the recombination distances are highly variable in these genetic crosses between cultivated and wild species of maize.},

Here we use transcription activator\textendash like effector nuclease (TALEN) and clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 (refs. 4,5) technologies in hexaploid bread wheat to introduce targeted mutations in the three homoeoalleles that encode MILDEW-RESISTANCE LOCUS (MLO) proteins. Genetic redundancy has prevented evaluation of whether mutation of all three MLO alleles in bread wheat might confer resistance to powdery mildew, a trait not found in natural populations. We show that TALEN-induced mutation of all three TaMLO homoeologs in the same plant confers heritable broad-spectrum resistance to powdery mildew. We further use CRISPR-Cas9 technology to generate transgenic wheat plants that carry mutations in the TaMLO-A1 allele. We also demonstrate the feasibility of engineering targeted DNA insertion in bread wheat through nonhomologous end joining of the double-strand breaks caused by TALENs.

  abstract = {Intraspecific variability in social organization is common, yet the underlying causes are rarely known. In the fire ant Solenopsis invicta, the existence of two divergent forms of social organization is under the control of a single Mendelian genomic element marked by two variants of an odorant-binding protein gene. Here we characterize the genomic region responsible for this important social polymorphism, and show that it is part of a pair of heteromorphic chromosomes that have many of the key properties of sex chromosomes. The two variants, hereafter referred to as the social B and social b (SB and Sb) chromosomes, are characterized by a large region of approximately 13 megabases (55\% of the chromosome) in which recombination is completely suppressed between SB and Sb. Recombination seems to occur normally between the SB chromosomes but not between Sb chromosomes because Sb/Sb individuals are non-viable. Genomic comparisons revealed limited differentiation between SB and Sb, and the vast majority of the 616 genes identified in the non-recombining region are present in the two variants. The lack of recombination over more than half of the two heteromorphic social chromosomes can be explained by at least one large inversion of around 9 megabases, and this absence of recombination has led to the accumulation of deleterious mutations, including repetitive elements in the non-recombining region of Sb compared with the homologous region of SB. Importantly, most of the genes with demonstrated expression differences between individuals of the two social forms reside in the non-recombining region. These findings highlight how genomic rearrangements can maintain divergent adaptive social phenotypes involving many genes acting together by locally limiting recombination.},

  abstract = {Here we report the genome sequence of the honeybee Apis mellifera, a key model for social behaviour and essential to global ecology through pollination. Compared with other sequenced insect genomes, the A. mellifera genome has high A+T and CpG contents, lacks major transposon families, evolves more slowly, and is more similar to vertebrates for circadian rhythm, RNA interference and DNA methylation genes, among others. Furthermore, A. mellifera has fewer genes for innate immunity, detoxification enzymes, cuticle-forming proteins and gustatory receptors, more genes for odorant receptors, and novel genes for nectar and pollen utilization, consistent with its ecology and social organization. Compared to Drosophila, genes in early developmental pathways differ in Apis, whereas similarities exist for functions that differ markedly, such as sex determination, brain function and behaviour. Population genetics suggests a novel African origin for the species A. mellifera and insights into whether Africanized bees spread throughout the New World via hybridization or displacement.},

Compared with other sequenced insect genomes, the A. mellifera genome has high A+T and CpG contents, lacks major transposon families, evolves more slowly, and is more similar to vertebrates for circadian rhythm, RNA interference and DNA methylation genes, among others. Furthermore, A. mellifera has fewer genes for innate immunity, detoxification enzymes, cuticle-forming proteins and gustatory receptors, more genes for odorant receptors, and novel genes for nectar and pollen utilization, consistent with its ecology and social organization. Compared to Drosophila, genes in early developmental pathways differ in Apis, whereas similarities exist for functions that differ markedly, such as sex determination, brain function and behaviour. Population genetics suggests a novel African origin for the species A. mellifera and insights into whether Africanized bees spread throughout the New World via hybridization or displacement.},

The formation of the sun and solar nebulae is addressed, and the coagulation of grains and the formation of small planetesimals are covered, along with the gravitational accumulation of planetesimals into planetary embryos and final stages of accumulation - embryos of planets. It is pointed out that the final stage of accumulation consists of the collision of these embryos; because of their large size, particularly after their further growth, these collisions represent giant impacts. It is concluded that the earth was initially an extremely hot and melted planet, surrounded by a fragile atmosphere and subject to violent impacts by bodies of the size of Ceres and even the moon.},

Some data on infections in monkfish (Kathetostorna giganteum) are also presented. There was no evidence of postmortem migration of larvae in red cod, red gurnard, or barracouta. The larvae did excapsulate postmortem and the excapsulation was less in fish kept on ice. The majority of larvae were associated with the visceral organs and membranes (98.5\% or more of the total worm burden). However, a proportion of all fish species examined had small numbers of larvae in the fillets and these may pose a risk to human health},

  abstract = {Elucidating relationships among early animal lineages has been difficult, and recent phylogenomic analyses place Ctenophora sister to all other extant animals, contrary to the traditional view of Porifera as the earliest-branching animal lineage. To date, phylogenetic support for either ctenophores or sponges as sister to other animals has been limited and inconsistent among studies. Lack of agreement among phylogenomic analyses using different data and methods obscures how complex traits, such as epithelia, neurons, and muscles evolved. A consensus view of animal evolution will not be accepted until datasets and methods converge on a single hypothesis of early metazoan relationships and putative sources of systematic error (e.g., long-branch attraction, compositional bias, poor model choice) are assessed. Here, we investigate possible causes of systematic error by expanding taxon sampling with eight novel transcriptomes, strictly enforcing orthology inference criteria, and progressively examining potential causes of systematic error while using both maximum-likelihood with robust data partitioning and Bayesian inference with a site-heterogeneous model. We identified ribosomal protein genes as possessing a conflicting signal compared with other genes, which caused some past studies to infer ctenophores and cnidarians as sister. Importantly, biases resulting from elevated compositional heterogeneity or elevated substitution rates are ruled out. Placement of ctenophores as sister to all other animals, and sponge monophyly, are strongly supported under multiple analyses, herein.},

Nevertheless, few attempts have been made to model explicitly the relationship between the relative number of combatants on each side and the costs and benefits of entering a contest. One framework that may be especially suitable for making such explicit predictions is Lanchester's theory of combat, which has proved useful for understanding combat strategies in humans and several species of ants. We show, with data from a recent series of playback experiments, that a model derived from Lanchester's 'square law' predicts willingness to enter intergroup contests in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Furthermore, the model predicts that, in contests with multiple individuals on each side, chimpanzees in this population should be willing to enter a contest only if they outnumber the opposing side by a factor of 1.5. We evaluate these results for intergroup encounters in chimpanzees and also discuss potential applications of Lanchester's square and linear laws for understanding combat strategies in other species.},

  abstract = {Key message A high level of genetic diversity was found in the A. E. Watkins bread wheat landrace collection. Genotypic information was used to determine the population structure and to develop germplasm resources. Abstract In the 1930s A. E. Watkins acquired landrace cultivars of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from official channels of the board of Trade in London, many of which originated from local markets in 32 countries. The geographic distribution of the 826 landrace cultivars of the current collection, here called the Watkins collection, covers many Asian and European countries and some from Africa. The cultivars were genotyped with 41 microsatellite markers in order to investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of the collection. A high level of genetic diversity was found, higher than in a collection of modern European winter bread wheat varieties from 1945 to 2000. Furthermore, although weak, the population structure of the Watkins collection reveals nine ancestral geographical groupings. An exchange of genetic material between ancestral groups before commercial wheat-breeding started would be a possible explanation for this. The increased knowledge regarding the diversity of the Watkins collection was used to develop resources for wheat research and breeding, one of them a core set, which captures the majority of the genetic diversity detected. The understanding of genetic diversity and population structure together with the availability of breeding resources should help to accelerate the detection of new alleles in the Watkins collection.},

Additionally, it is of importance for future improvement of the crop, particularly in the light of climate change. Focusing on the adaptation after domestication, a nested association mapping (NAM) panel of 60 segregating biparental populations was developed, mainly involving landrace accessions from the core set of the Watkins hexaploid wheat collection optimized for genetic diversity. A modern spring elite variety, ``Paragon,'' was used as common reference parent. Genetic maps were constructed following identical rules to make them comparable. In total, 1611 linkage groups were identified, based on recombination from an estimated 126,300 crossover events over the whole NAM panel. A consensus map, named landrace consensus map (LRC), was constructed and contained 2498 genetic loci. These newly developed genetics tools were used to investigate the rules underlying genome fluidity or rigidity, e.g., by comparing marker distances and marker orders. In general, marker order was highly correlated, which provides support for strong synteny between bread wheat accessions. However, many exceptional cases of incongruent linkage groups and increased marker distances were also found. Segregation distortion was detected for many markers, sometimes as hot spots present in different populations. Furthermore, evidence for translocations in at least 36 of the maps was found. These translocations fell, in general, into many different translocation classes, but a few translocation classes were found in several accessions, the most frequent one being the well-known T5B:7B translocation. Loci involved in recombination rate, which is an interesting trait for plant breeding, were identified by QTL analyses using the crossover counts as a trait.

  abstract = {Genome comparisons indicate that horizontal gene transfer and differential gene loss are major evolutionary phenomena that, at least in prokaryotes, involve a large fraction, if not the majority, of genes. The extent of these events casts doubt on the feasibility of constructing a 'Tree of Life', because the trees for different genes often tell different stories. However, alternative approaches to tree construction that attempt to determine tree topology on the basis of comparisons of complete gene sets seem to reveal a phylogenetic signal that supports the three-domain evolutionary scenario and suggests the possibility of delineation of previously undetected major clades of prokaryotes. If the validity of these whole-genome approaches to tree building is confirmed by analyses of numerous new genomes, which are currently being sequenced at an increasing rate, it would seem that the concept of a universal 'species' tree is still appropriate. However, this tree should be reinterpreted as a prevailing trend in the evolution of genome-scale gene sets rather than as a complete picture of evolution.},

  abstract = {Creating a robust synthetic surface that repels various liquids would have broad technological implications for areas ranging from biomedical devices and fuel transport to architecture but has proved extremely challenging. Inspirations from natural nonwetting structures, particularly the leaves of the lotus, have led to the development of liquid-repellent microtextured surfaces that rely on the formation of a stable air-liquid interface. Despite over a decade of intense research, these surfaces are, however, still plagued with problems that restrict their practical applications: limited oleophobicity with high contact angle hysteresis, failure under pressure and upon physical damage, inability to self-heal and high production cost. To address these challenges, here we report a strategy to create self-healing, slippery liquid-infused porous surface(s) (SLIPS) with exceptional liquid- and ice-repellency, pressure stability and enhanced optical transparency. Our approach-inspired by Nepenthes pitcher plants-is conceptually different from the lotus effect, because we use nano/microstructured substrates to lock in place the infused lubricating fluid. We define the requirements for which the lubricant forms a stable, defect-free and inert 'slippery' interface. This surface outperforms its natural counterparts and state-of-the-art synthetic liquid-repellent surfaces in its capability to repel various simple and complex liquids (water, hydrocarbons, crude oil and blood), maintain low contact angle hysteresis (\textbackslash textless2.5\textdegree ), quickly restore liquid-repellency after physical damage (within 0.1-1 s), resist ice adhesion, and function at high pressures (up to about 680 atm). We show that these properties are insensitive to the precise geometry of the underlying substrate, making our approach applicable to various inexpensive, low-surface-energy structured materials (such as porous Teflon membrane). We envision that these slippery surfaces will be useful in fluid handling and transportation, optical sensing, medicine, and as self-cleaning and anti-fouling materials operating in extreme environments.},

  abstract = {Genetic linkage maps are cornerstones of a wide spectrum of biotechnology applications, including map-assisted breeding, association genetics, and map-assisted gene cloning. During the past several years, the adoption of high-throughput genotyping technologies has been paralleled by a substantial increase in the density and diversity of genetic markers. New genetic mapping algorithms are needed in order to efficiently process these large datasets and accurately construct high-density genetic maps. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm to order markers on a genetic linkage map. Our method is based on a simple yet fundamental mathematical property that we prove under rather general assumptions. The validity of this property allows one to determine efficiently the correct order of markers by computing the minimum spanning tree of an associated graph. Our empirical studies obtained on genotyping data for three mapping populations of barley (Hordeum vulgare), as well as extensive simulations on synthetic data, show that our algorithm consistently outperforms the best available methods in the literature, particularly when the input data are noisy or incomplete. The software implementing our algorithm is available in the public domain as a web tool under the name MSTmap., Genetic linkage maps are cornerstones of a wide spectrum of biotechnology applications. In recent years, new high-throughput genotyping technologies have substantially increased the density and diversity of genetic markers, creating new algorithmic challenges for computational biologists. In this paper, we present a novel algorithmic method to construct genetic maps based on a new theoretical insight. Our approach outperforms the best methods available in the scientific literature, particularly when the input data are noisy or incomplete.},

  abstract = {High-density oligonucleotide expression arrays are widely used in many areas of biomedical research. Affymetrix GeneChip arrays are the most popular. In the Affymetrix system, a fair amount of further preprocessing and data reduction occurs after the image-processing step. Statistical procedures developed by academic groups have been successful in improving the default algorithms provided by the Affymetrix system. In this article we present a solution to one of the preprocessing steps\textemdash background adjustment\textemdash based on a formal statistical framework. Our solution greatly improves the performance of the technology in various practical applications. These arrays use short oligonucleotides to probe for genes in an RNA sample. Typically, each gene is represented by 11\textendash 20 pairs of oligonucleotide probes. The first component of these pairs is referred to as a perfect match probe and is designed to hybridize only with transcripts from the intended gene (i. e., specific hybridization). However, hybridization by other sequences (i. e., nonspecific hybridization) is unavoidable. Furthermore, hybridization strengths are measured by a scanner that introduces optical noise. Therefore, the observed intensities need to be adjusted to give accurate measurements of specific hybridization. We have found that the default ad hoc adjustment, provided as part of the Affymetrix system, can be improved through the use of estimators derived from a statistical model that uses probe sequence information. A final step in preprocessing is to summarize the probe-level data for each gene to define a measure of expression that represents the amount of the corresponding mRNA species. In this article we illustrate the practical consequences of not adjusting appropriately for the presence of nonspecific hybridization and provide a solution based on our background adjustment procedure. Software that computes our adjustment is available as part of the Bioconductor Project (http://www.bioconductor.org).},

Two complementary approaches for genetic mapping, linkage mapping and association mapping have led to successful dissection of complex traits in many crop species. Both of these methods detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) by identifying marker\textendash trait associations, and the only fundamental difference between them is that between mapping populations, which directly determine mapping resolution and power. Based on this difference, we first summarize in this review the advances and limitations of family-based mapping and natural population-based mapping instead of linkage mapping and association mapping. We then describe statistical methods used for improving detection power and computational speed and outline emerging areas such as large-scale meta-analysis for genetic mapping in crops. In the era of next-generation sequencing, there has arisen an urgent need for proper population design, advanced statistical strategies, and precision phenotyping to fully exploit high-throughput genotyping.},

  abstract = {Hybrid sterility is a major form of postzygotic reproductive isolation that restricts gene flow between populations. Cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) consists of two subspecies, indica and japonica; inter-subspecific hybrids are usually sterile. We show that a killer-protector system at the S5 locus encoded by three tightly linked genes [Open Reading Frame 3 (ORF3) to ORF5] regulates fertility in indica-japonica hybrids. During female sporogenesis, the action of ORF5+ (killer) and ORF4+ (partner) causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. ORF3+ (protector) prevents ER stress and produces normal gametes, but ORF3\textendash{} cannot prevent ER stress, resulting in premature programmed cell death and leads to embryo-sac abortion. Preferential transmission of ORF3+ gametes results in segregation distortion in the progeny. These results add to our understanding of differences between indica and japonica rice and may aid in rice genetic improvement. A genetic locus containing three protein-coding genes underlies the system causing hybrid sterility among rice species.

Full sunlight inhibited hypocotyl growth to a larger extent in wild-type (WT) than in phyA, phyB and, particularly, hy4 seedlings, In WT seedlings, hypocotyl growth was promoted by selectively lowering BL irradiance, lowering red-light (R) plus far-red-light (FR) irradiance or lowering the R/FR ratio (which was achieved either by increasing FR or by reducing R). The effects of lowering BL were reduced in hy4 and exaggerated in phyA seedlings, The effects of lowering R+FR were reduced in phyA and exaggerated in hy4 seedlings, Neither phyB nor hy4 mutants responded to low R/FR ratios, Neighbouring plants reflecting FR without shading caused subtle reductions of the R/FR ratio, This signal promoted hypocotyl growth in WT but not in phyA, phyB or hy4 seedlings, Intermediate canopy shade produced similar effects in all genotypes, Under deep shade, de-etiolation was severely impaired in phyA seedlings, which died prematurely, Thus, the FR 'high-irradiance reaction' mediated by phyA could be important for seedling survival under dense canopies.},

  abstract = {The awn is a long needle-like structure formed at the tip of the lemma in the florets of some grass species. It plays a role in seed dispersal and protection against animals, and can contribute to the photosynthetic activity of spikes. Three main dominant inhibitors of awn development (Hd, B1 and B2) are known in hexaploid wheat, but the causal genes have not been cloned yet and a genetic association with awn length diversity has been found only for the B1 allele. To analyze the prevalence of these three awning inhibitors, we attempted to predict the genotypes of 189 hexaploid wheat varieties collected worldwide using markers tightly linked to these loci. Using recombinant inbred lines derived from two common wheat cultivars, Chinese Spring and Mironovskaya 808, both with short awns, and a high-density linkage map, we performed quantitative trait locus analysis to identify tightly linked markers. Because this linkage map was constructed with abundant array-based markers, we converted the linked markers to PCR-based markers and determined the genotypes of 189 hexaploids. A significant genotype-phenotype correlation was observed at the Hd and B1 regions. We also found that interaction among these three awning inhibitors is involved in development of a membranous outgrowth at the base of awn resembling the Hooded mutants of barley. For the hooded awn phenotype, presence of the Hd dominant allele was essential but not sufficient, so B2 and other factors appear to act epistatically to produce the ectopic tissue. On the other hand, the dominant B1 allele acted as a suppressor of the hooded phenotype. These three awning inhibitors largely contribute to the genetic variation in awn length and shape of common wheat.},

  abstract = {SummaryWith the advent of high density restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) maps, it has become possible to determine the genotype of an individual at many genetic loci simultaneously. Often, such RFLP data are expressed as long strings of numbers or letters indicating the genotype for each locus analyzed. In this form, RFLP data can be difficult to interpret or utilize without complex statistical analysis. By contrast, numerical genotype data can also be expressed in a more useful, graphical form, known as a ``graphical genotype'', which is described in detail in this paper. Ideally, a graphical genotype portrays the parental origin and allelic composition throughout the entire genome, yet is simple to comprehend and utilize. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of this concept, graphical genotypes for individuals from backcross and F2 populations in tomato are described. The concept can also be utilized in more complex mating schemes involving two or more parents. A model that predicts the accuracy of graphical genotypes is presented for hypothetical RFLP maps of varying marker spacing. This model indicates that graphical genotypes can be more than 99\% correct in describing a genome of total size, 1000 cM, with RFLP markers located every 10 cM. In order to facilitate the application of graphical genotypes to genetics and breeding, we have developed computer software that generates and manipulates graphical genotypes. The concept of graphical genotypes should be useful in whole genome selection for polygenic traits in plant and animal breeding programs and in the diagnosis of heterogenously based genetic diseases in humans.},

Specific antibodies were raised against the two CENH3 proteins and were co-localized to centromeres with subtle differences. In most tetraploid wheat species, CENH3 genes are more highly expressed from the AA genome. In wild tetraploids, {$\beta$}CENH3 has a much lower expression level than {$\alpha$}CENH3, while in cultivated tetraploids {$\beta$}CENH3 transcripts are enhanced to near {$\alpha$}CENH3 levels. Comparison of the CENH3 proteins in wild and cultivated tetraploids revealed that the histone folding domain (HFD) of only {$\beta$}CENH3 is under positive selection, especially in the region responsible for targeting of CENH3 to the centromere. * Taken together, positive selection of {$\beta$}CENH3 and its increased expression in tetraploid cultivars are indicative of adaptive evolution. Furthermore, the differences in localization between {$\alpha$}CENH3 and {$\beta$}CENH3 observed using fiber fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunodetection and in developmental phenotypes resulting from virus-reduced gene silencing imply their functional diversification during wheat evolution.},

Presumably, whatever chemistry gave rise to RNA would have produced other RNA analogues, some of which may have preceded or competed directly with RNA. Threose nucleic acid (TNA), a potentially natural derivative of RNA, has received considerable interest as a possible RNA progenitor due to its chemical simplicity and ability to exchange genetic information with itself and RNA. Here, we have applied Darwinian evolution methods to evolve, in vitro, a TNA receptor that binds to an arbitrary target with high affinity and specificity. This demonstration shows that TNA has the ability to fold into tertiary structures with sophisticated chemical functions, which provides evidence that TNA could have served as an ancestral genetic system during an early stage of life.},

  abstract = {The proportion of loci deviating from the expected monogenic segregation ratios in the genera Lens. Capsicum, and Lycopersicon is significantly higher (61/114 genes, 54\%) for progeny of interspecific hybrids than for progeny of intraspecific hybrids (7/52 genes, 13\%). Although aberrant segregations are expected to be more common in progeny of interspecific hybrids, this is the first estimate of the magnitude of this phenomenon, based on a random sample of genes in a number of plant genera. We interpret these unequal segregations as the result of linkage between the markers and gene(s) that operate in pre- and postzygotic phases of reproduction. Such unequal segregations should be considered in planning breeding programs.},

How this diversity originated and evolved is not well understood because phylogenetic relationships among major cnidarian lineages are unclear, and recent studies present contrasting phylogenetic hypotheses. Here, we use transcriptome data from 15 newly-sequenced species in combination with 26 publicly available genomes and transcriptomes to assess phylogenetic relationships among major cnidarian lineages. Phylogenetic analyses using different partition schemes and models of molecular evolution, as well as topology tests for alternative phylogenetic relationships, support the monophyly of Medusozoa, Anthozoa, Octocorallia, Hydrozoa, and a clade consisting of Staurozoa, Cubozoa, and Scyphozoa. Support for the monophyly of Hexacorallia is weak due to the equivocal position of Ceriantharia. Taken together, these results further resolve deep cnidarian relationships, largely support traditional phylogenetic views on relationships, and provide a historical framework for studying the evolutionary processes involved in one of the most ancient animal radiations.},

Some interspecies differences stem from the diversity of genome size and composition among eukaryotes.

Chromatin patterns, including histone modifications and DNA methylation, are also responsible for interspecies differences as well as differences between the sexes. Finally, despite the overall recombination pathway conservation, there are species-specific components that result in distinct recombination patterns. Consequently, characteristics that are defining for the recombination landscape and universally shared by all eukaryotes remain largely to be discovered.},

  abstract = {Missing marker and segregation distortion are commonly encountered in actual quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping populations. Our objective in this study was to investigate the impact of the two factors on QTL mapping through computer simulations. Results indicate that detection power decreases with increasing levels of missing markers, and the false discovery rate increases. Missing markers have greater effects on smaller effect QTL and smaller size populations. The effect of missing markers can be quantified by a population with a reduced size similar to the marker missing rate. As for segregation distortion, if the distorted marker is not closely linked with any QTL, it will not have significant impact on QTL mapping; otherwise, the impact of the distortion will depend on the degree of dominance of QTL, frequencies of the three marker types, the linkage distance between the distorted marker and QTL, and the mapping population size. Sometimes, the distortion can result in a higher genetic variance than that of non-distortion, and therefore benefits the detection of linked QTL. A formula of the ratio of genetic variance explained by QTL under distortion and non-distortion was given in this study, so as to easily determine whether the segregation distortion marker (SDM) increases or decreases the QTL detection power. The effect of SDM decreases rapidly as its linkage relationship with QTL becomes looser. In general, distorted markers will not have a great effect on the position and effect estimations of QTL, and their effects can be ignored in large-size mapping populations.},

Deep genetic divergence between the two main varietal groups (Indica and Japonica) suggests domestication from at least two distinct wild populations. However, genetic uniformity surrounding key domestication genes across divergent subpopulations suggests cultural exchange of genetic material among ancient farmers. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we utilize a novel 1,536 SNP panel genotyped across 395 diverse accessions of O. sativa to study genome-wide patterns of polymorphism, to characterize population structure, and to infer the introgression history of domesticated Asian rice. Our population structure analyses support the existence of five major subpopulations (indica, aus, tropical japonica, temperate japonica and GroupV) consistent with previous analyses. Our introgression analysis shows that most accessions exhibit some degree of admixture, with many individuals within a population sharing the same introgressed segment due to artificial selection. Admixture mapping and association analysis of amylose content and grain length illustrate the potential for dissecting the genetic basis of complex traits in domesticated plant populations. Conclusions/Significance Genes in these regions control a myriad of traits including plant stature, blast resistance, and amylose content. These analyses highlight the power of population genomics in agricultural systems to identify functionally important regions of the genome and to decipher the role of human-directed breeding in refashioning the genomes of a domesticated species.},

T1Rs are candidate mammalian taste receptors that combine to assemble two heteromeric G-protein-coupled receptor complexes: T1R1+3, an umami sensor, and T1R2+3, a sweet receptor. We now report the behavioral and physiological characterization of T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3 knockout mice. We demonstrate that sweet and umami taste are strictly dependent on T1R-receptors, and show that selective elimination of T1R-subunits differentially abolishes detection and perception of these two taste modalities. To examine the basis of sweet tastant recognition and coding, we engineered animals expressing either the human T1R2-receptor (hT1R2), or a modified opioid-receptor (RASSL) in sweet cells. Expression of hT1R2 in mice generates animals with humanized sweet taste preferences, while expression of RASSL drives strong attraction to a synthetic opiate, demonstrating that sweet cells trigger dedicated behavioral outputs, but their tastant selectivity is determined by the nature of the receptors.},

Here we demonstrate that the CDKG1/CYCLINL complex is essential for synapsis and recombination during male meiosis. A transfer-DNA insertional mutation in the cdkg1 gene leads to a temperature-sensitive failure of meiosis in late Zygotene/Pachytene that is associated with defective formation of the synaptonemal complex, reduced bivalent formation and crossing over, and aneuploid gametes. An aphenotypic insertion in the cyclin L gene, a cognate cyclin for CDKG, strongly enhances the phenotype of cdkg1\textendash 1 mutants, indicating that this cdk\textendash cyclin complex is essential for male meiosis. Since CYCLINL, CDKG, and their mammalian homologs have been previously shown to affect mRNA processing, particularly alternative splicing, our observations also suggest a mechanism to explain the widespread phenomenon of thermal sensitivity in male meiosis.},

  abstract = {The sequences of the nuclear ribosomal DNA region spanning the first internal transcribed spacer, the 5.8S rRNA gene and the second internal transcribed spacer were determined for Ascaris samples from pigs and humans from different geographical regions. The sequences of the 5.8S gene and the second internal transcribed spacer were the same for all samples examined, whereas all Ascaris samples from humans had six (1.3\%) nucleotide differences in the first internal transcribed spacer compared with those from pigs. These differences provided some support for the existence of separate species of Ascaris or population variation within this genus. Using a nucleotide difference within a site for the restriction enzyme HaeIII, a PCR-linked restriction fragment length polymorphism method was established which allowed the delineation of the Ascaris samples from pigs and humans used herein. Exploiting the sequence differences in the first internal transcribed spacer, a PCR-based single-strand conformation polymorphism method was established for future analysis of the genetic structure of pig and human Ascaris populations in sympatric and allopatric zones.},

  abstract = {Recombination is a prominent feature of meiosis in which it plays an important role in increasing genetic diversity during inheritance. Additionally, in most organisms, recombination also plays mechanical roles in chromosomal processes, most notably to mediate pairing of homologous chromosomes during prophase and, ultimately, to ensure regular segregation of homologous chromosomes when they separate at the first meiotic division. Recombinational interactions are also subject to important spatial patterning at both early and late stages. Recombination-mediated processes occur in physical and functional linkage with meiotic axial chromosome structure, with interplay in both directions, before, during, and after formation and dissolution of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a highly conserved meiosis-specific structure that links homolog axes along their lengths. These diverse processes also are integrated with recombination-independent interactions between homologous chromosomes, nonhomology-based chromosome couplings/clusterings, and diverse types of chromosome movement. This review provides an overview of these diverse processes and their interrelationships.},

  abstract = {Common bread wheat, Triticum aestivum, has one of the most complex genomes known to science, with 6 copies of each chromosome, enormous numbers of near-identical sequences scattered throughout, and an overall haploid size of more than 15 billion bases. Multiple past attempts to assemble the genome have produced assemblies that were well short of the estimated genome size. Here we report the first near-complete assembly of T. aestivum, using deep sequencing coverage from a combination of short Illumina reads and very long Pacific Biosciences reads. The final assembly contains 15 344 693 583 bases and has a weighted average (N50) contig size of 232 659 bases. This represents by far the most complete and contiguous assembly of the wheat genome to date, providing a strong foundation for future genetic studies of this important food crop. We also report how we used the recently published genome of Aegilops tauschii, the diploid ancestor of the wheat D genome, to identify 4 179 762 575 bp of T. aestivum that correspond to its D genome components.},

The linkage map covered a large part of the length of the genome. A deviation to the 1{$:$}1 segregation expected in the absence of selection was observed for at least one chromosome segment. This might be linked to a gene or group of genes selected because of their involvment in the process of haploid production.},

Some of the biochemists point out, or imply, that the interest in the biochemical foundation of evolutionary relationships between organisms is a second-rate interest. According to them (and to us), what most counts in the life sciences today is the uncovering of the molecular mechanisms that underly the observations of classical biology. The concept of mechanism should, however, not be applied exclu-sively to short-timed processes. The type of molecules that have been called informational macromolecules (68) or semantides (758) (DNA, RNA, proteins) has a unique role in determining the properties of living matter in each of three perspectives that differ by the magnitude of time required for the processes involved. These processes are the short-timed},

  abstract = {Walter Heiligenberg (1938-1994) was an exceptionally gifted behavioral physiologist who made enormous contributions to the analysis of behavior and to our understanding of how the brain initiates and controls species-typical behavioral patterns. He was distinguished by his rigorous analytical approach used in both behavioral studies and neuroethological investigations. Among his most significant contributions to neuroethology are a detailed analysis of the computational rules governing the jamming avoidance response in weakly electric fish and the elucidation of the principal neural pathway involved in neural control of this behavior. Based on his work, the jamming avoidance response is perhaps the best-understood vertebrate behavior pattern in terms of the underlying neural substrate. In addition to this pioneering work, Heiligenberg stimulated research in a significant number of other areas of ethology and neuroethology, including: the quantitative assessment of aggressivity in cichlid fish; the ethological analysis of the stimulus-response relationship in the chirping behavior of crickets; the exploration of the neural and endocrine basis of communicatory behavior in weakly electric fish; the study of cellular mechanisms of neuronal plasticity in the adult fish brain; and the phylogenetic analysis of electric fishes using a combination of morphology, electrophysiology, and mitochondrial sequence data.},
